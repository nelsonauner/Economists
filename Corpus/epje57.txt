Paying people on the basis of how their performance relates to a budget or target causes people to game the system and in doing so to destroy value in two main ways: (a) both superiors and subordinates lie in the formulation of budgets and, therefore, gut the budgeting process of the critical unbiased information that is required to coordinate the activities of disparate parts of an organisation, and (b) they game the realisation of the budgets or targets and in doing so destroy value for their organisations. Although most managers and analysts understand that budget gaming is widespread, few understand the huge costs it imposes on organisations and how to lower them.

Managers up and down the hierarchy work hard at putting together plans and budgets for the next year only to discover that the bottom line falls far short of Wall Street's expectations. CEOs and CFOs are therefore left in a difficult situation; they can stretch to try to meet Wall Street's projections or prepare to suffer the consequences if they fail. 2002 Morgan Stanley."] [' This paper examines the role of the corporate objective function in corporate productivity and efficiency, social welfare, and the accountability of managers and directors. The author argues that because it is logically impossible to maximize in more than one dimension, purposeful behavior requires a single-valued objective function. Two hundred years of work in economics and finance implies that, in the absence of externalities and monopoly, social welfare is maximized when each firm in an economy maximizes its total market value. 2001 Morgan Stanley.'] [' This paper discusses five common divisional performance measurement methods-cost centers, revenue centers, profit centers, investment centers, and expense centers-and provides the beginnings of a theory that attempts to explain when each of these five methods is likely to be the most efficient. The central insight of the theory is that each of these methods offers an alternative way of aligning decision-making authority with valuable "specific knowledge" inside the organization. 1999 Morgan Stanley.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' Since 1973 technological, political, regulatory, and economic forces have been changing the worldwide economy in a fashion comparable to the changes experienced during the nineteenth century Industrial Revolution. As in the nineteenth century, we are experiencing declining costs, increasing average (but decreasing marginal) productivity of labor, reduced growth rates of labor income, excess capacity, and the requirement for downsizing and exit. The last two decades indicate corporate internal control systems have failed to deal effectively with these changes, especially slow growth and the requirement for exit. The next several decades pose a major challenge for Western firms and political systems as these forces continue to work their way through the worldwide economy.

Although the incentives generated by stock ownership are large relative to pay and dismissal incentives, most CEOs hold trivial fractions of the firms' stock, and ownership levels have declined over the past fifty years. The authors hypothesize that public and private political forces impose constraints that reduce the pay-performance sensitivity. Declines in both the pay-performance relation and the level of CEO pay since the 1930s are consistent with this hypothesis.

This allocation is then compared to those allocations which (1) maximize nominal social wealth or (2) maximize social welfare. These comparisons are made under a variety of assumptions concerning the nature of the new opportunities, investor attitudes toward risk, and the number and characteristics of firms in the economy. With the exception of certain special cases, it is found that the private allocation of investment does not correspond to that which either maximizes social wealth or maximizes social welfare.'] [' This paper is a review of the foundations and current state of mean-variance capital market theory. This work, whose foundations lie in the mean-variance portfolio model of Markowitz, deals with determination of the prices of capital assets under conditions of uncertainty. The Sharpe-Lintner capital asset pricing model which forms the core of this body of literature is an investigation of the implications of the normative Markowitz model for the equilibrium structure of asset prices. The essential characteristics of these models are reviewed along with the current state of the empirical evidence bearing on them. Many of the recent extensions of the theory are also reviewed and some attempt is made to integrate these extensions with the currently available empirical evidence.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.']
