The estimated model accounts for a substantial fraction of the cyclical variation in output and is consistent with the observed inertia in inflation. This is true even though firms in the model reoptimize prices on average once every 1.8 quarters. The key feature of our model underlying this result is that capital is firm-specific. If we adopt the standard assumption that capital is homogeneous and traded in economy-wide rental markets, we find that firms reoptimize their prices on average once every 9 quarters.

The framework incorporates a banking sector and distinguishes between M1, the monetary base, currency and various measures of reserves: total, excess and non borrowed. We use a variant of the model to analyze two sets of empirical facts. The first set of facts is that different monetary aggregates covary differently with short term nominal interest rates. Broad monetary aggregates like M1 and the monetary base covary positively with current and future values of short term interest rates. In contrast, the non borrowed reserves of banks covary negatively with current and future interest rates. Observations like this `sign switch' lie at the core of recent debates about the effects of monetary policy actions on short term interest rates. According to our model, the sign switch occurs because movements in non borrowed reserves are dominated by exogenous shocks to monetary policy, while movements in the base and M1 are dominated by endogenous responses to non-policy shocks. The second set of facts that we consider is that broad monetary aggregates covary positively with output.
