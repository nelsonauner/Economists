 ['The authors use a rich personnel data set from a Russian firm for the years 1997 to 2002 to analyze how the firm adjusts wages and employment during this period in which local labor market conditions changed in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 1998. They relate the development of turnover and wages for various employment categories to alternative models of wage and employment determination. The authors argue that the firm\xc3\xads behavior is consistent with the predictions of efficiency wage models of the shirking and turnover type.'] [' L11, O12, P31.

We assemble and analyse three separate types of evidence. First, we find that countries that were initially relatively poor prior to planning benefited more, as measured by long-run GDP per capita levels, from infrastructure and human capital than they suffered from weak market incentives. For initially relatively rich countries the opposite is true. Second, using various measures of physical stocks of infrastructure and human capital we show that at the end of planning, formerly planned countries had substantially different endowments from their contemporaneous market economy counterparts. However, these differences were much more important for poor than for rich countries. Finally, we use firm-level data to measure the cost of a wide range of constraints on firm performance, and we show that after more than a decade of transition in 2002\xe2\x80\x9305, poor ex-planned economies differ much more from their market counterparts, in respect to both good and bad aspects of the planning legacy, than do relatively rich ones. However, the persistent beneficial legacy effects disappeared under the pressure of strong growth in the formerly planned economies in the run-up to the global financial crisis.'] ['This paper draws on evidence from the last two centuries of industrialisation, analysing the evolution of energy intensity over the long- and short-run. We argue that the increased specialisation of the fuel mix, coupled with accelerating convergence of both the sectoral and technological composition of economies, will continue to improve energy intensity of economic output and to reduce the reliance on any single energy resource. This analysis suggests that even high growth in per capita income over the next 20 years need not be constrained by resource availability.'] ['We review the Stata statistical package and evaluate its suitability for applied research.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ["We extend our 2003 paper on instrumental variables and generalized method of moments estimation, and we test and describe enhanced routines that address heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent standard errors, weak instruments, limited-information maximum likelihood and k-class estimation, tests for endogeneity and Ramsey's regression specification-error test, and autocorrelation tests for instrumental variable estimates and panel-data instrumental variable estimates.

This paper uses a simple model of economic development and structural change with technology spillovers to benchmark structural change in the transition economies and simulate the path of adjustment from central planning. We then analyse data from 10 accession candidates and 12 CIS countries to measure the progress in structural change that has taken place thus far and to assess the further structural changes that should be expected, with particular attention to the implications for accession.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ["This paper examines the importance of competition in innovation and the growth of firms. We make use of the large-scale natural experiment of the shift from an economic system without competition to a market economy to shed light on the factors that influence innovation by firms and their subsequent growth, thereby alleviating problems due to non-random clustering of innovation opportunities in mature market economies. We find evidence that monopolies innovate less and have weaker growth than firms facing a minimum of rivalry. The presence of competitors has both a direct effect on performance, and an indirect effect, through improving the efficiency with which the rents from market power in product markets are utilised to undertake innovation. There is also some less clear-cut evidence of an 'inverted-U', namely that the presence of a few rivals is more conducive to performance than the presence of many competitors."] ['We discuss instrumental variables (IV) estimation in the broader context of the generalized method of moments (GMM), and describe an extended IV estimation routine that provides GMM estimates as well as additional diagnostic tests. Stand-alone test procedures for heteroskedasticity, overidentification, and endogeneity in the IV context are also described.

A major innovation is the use of a market economy and member country of the EU - Spain - as a benchmark against which to measure progress in transition. The paper finds that new private firms (firms established as private ab initio) in both Poland and Romania are growing the fastest, but on measures of integration and investment, it is Polish ab initio private firms and privatized firms that look most similar to the Spanish. Polish state-owned firms, and Romanian state-owned, privatized and (to a lesser extent) ab initio private firms more often lag behind. With respect to compliance with EU directives, Poland tends to lag behind Spain but lie significantly ahead of Romania. Levels of awareness of and compliance with directives did not vary with ownership type amongst the Eastern European firms. Progress in transition at the country level seems to be consistent with improvements in compliance with the major components of the acquis.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['A magyar bankrendszerben a kilencvenes \xc3\xa9vek elej\xc3\xa9n ugr\xc3\xa1sszer\xc5\xb1en megn\xc5\x91tt a rossz hitelek \xc3\xa1llom\xc3\xa1nya.

First, an enterprise production function is estimated. The paper finds that for most enterprises, the resulting estimated marginal product of labor exceeds the wage paid by the enterprise by a considerable margin, suggesting general excess demand for labor. The paper then looks at how the difference between the MPL and the wage is related to the rate of change of employment, and finds that firms where the MPL is higher than the wage - firms which in a neoclassical model would have a large excess demand for labor - do not shed labor any more slowly than other firms.
