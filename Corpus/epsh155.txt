We compare monetary systems mediated by durable commodity monies, versus pure fiat monies, in order to understand the separation and eventual independence of the institutionally-created value of money from the values of underlying traded goods. We treat the emergence of monetary function as a problem in mechanism design, modeled by minimal strategic market games that overcome a generalized Jevons failure when agents must commit ahead of time to specialist resource production. We consider in particular the problem of defining closures with respect to both money flows and labor-allocation and trading decisions, and show that minimal models require many of the fundamental institutions of banking and contract enforcement found in real economies, in order to define a self-policing system. We define costs, value, and the efficiencies of the institutions that support trade in terms of a natural money-metric welfare function, and compare the characteristics of commodity and fiat monies by these measures. Through careful treatment of the stock/flow distinction in repeated-game settings, we find that commodity money, even when its value derives heavily from its institutional role, remains defined by its flow characteristics, in contrast to fiat money, for which the control function is defined inherently in terms of stock variables. Our notation is somewhat nonconventional for economics but to do justice to econo-physics concepts such as scaling and dimensional analysis and to stress the distinction between stocks and flows, we believe this notation is justified.

Sahi and Yao (1989) and Sorin (1996) constructed a strategic market game to prove that this is possible. We conduct an experimental game in which each agent issues her personal IOUs, and a costless efficient clearinghouse adjusts the exchange rates among them so the markets always clear. The results suggest that if the information system and clearing are so good as to preclude moral hazard, any form of information asymmetry, and need for trust, the economy operates efficiently at any price level without government money. These conditions cannot reasonably be expected to hold in natural settings. In a second set of treatments when agents have the option of not delivering on their promises, a high enough penalty for non-delivery is necessary to ensure an efficient market; a lower penalty leads to inefficient, even collapsing, markets due to moral hazard.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['We define and examine three minimal market games (sell-all, buy-sell, and double auction) in the laboratory relative to the predictions of theory.

A particular CE may be unstable under one price adjustment mechanism but stable under another. The joint dynamics of the chosen price adjustment mechanism and the given economy determines the overall stability of its competitive equilibrium.

The problem for the agent thus is to balance work and consumption. In contrast to many other economic models, this model prescribes the process in all completeness. The paper looks both at analytical solutions and at simulation results. A particularly important results is that a well-defined market only emerges when prices adapt on a much slower time scale than consumption.

In equilibrium theory, the value of money is generally not determined: the number of equations is one less than the number of unknowns, so only relative prices are determined. In the language of mathematics, the equations are 'homogeneous of order one'. Using the language of physics, this represents a continuous 'Goldstone' symmetry. However, the continuous symmetry is often broken by the dynamics of the system, thus fixing the value of the otherwise undetermined variable. In economics, the value of money is a strategic variable which each agent must determine at each transaction by estimating the effect of future interactions with other agents. This idea is illustrated by a simple network model of monopolistic vendors and buyers, with bounded rationality. We submit that dynamical, spontaneous symmetry breaking is the fundamental principle for fixing the value of money. Perhaps the continuous symmetry representing the lack of restoring force is also the fundamental reason for large fluctuations in stock markets."] ['Fiat money is a creation of both the state and society. Its value is supported by expectations which are conditioned by the dynamics of trust in government, the socio-economic structure and by outside events such as wars, plagues or political unrest. The micro-management of a dynamic economy is not far removed in difficulty from the micro-management of the weather. However, money and the financial institutions and instruments of a modern economy provide the means to influence expectations and bound behaviour. The control of the fiat money supply, together with rules on the granting of credit and the bankruptcy, default and reorganisation rules are public services. They provide lower and upper bounds for the price level in the economy. They also determine the innovation rate of the economy.

This leads to establishement size distributions, which we compare to reality.

The total production of commodity remains constant, but individual agents' endowments fluctuate in a random fashion from period to period. In order to hedge against these random fluctuations, agents find it useful to hold fiat money which they can borrow or deposit at appropriate rates of interest; such activity may take place either at a central bank (which fixes interest rates judiciously) or through a money-market (in which interest rates are determined endogenously).  We carry out an equilibrium analysis, based on a careful study of Dynamic Programming equations and on properties of the invariant measures for associated optimally-controlled Markov chains. This analysis yields the stationary distribution of wealth across agents, as well as the stationary price (for the commodity) and interest rates (for the borrowing and lending of fiat money).  A distinctive feature of our analysis is the incorporation of bankruptcy, both as a real possibility in an individual agent's optimization problem, and as a determinant of interest rates through appropriate balance equations.

Currently there exist separate schools of individuals working on interrelated but basically different areas. Each has its own special goals and terminology.

Different types of games and different purposes are discussed.

The consensus has been that in all three activities it has been of use. Many hundreds of games have been constructed and have been or are currently in use for a variety of purpose; for example, a recent publication gives summaries of eighty-nine business games. In spite of the considerable activity in gaming, little has been published on its costs. In the activities to which gaming has been applied, there have been or are well established alternatives methods for which the costs and worth are more or less known. It is in the light of these and possibly other alternatives that we must view the developments in gaming.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['A goal of good management should be to design a reward system for those who take risks in making decisions in such a manner that the rewards to the individual correlate positively with the worth of the decision to the organization (taking into account the attitude of the top management to variance as well as to expected gain).

In this paper we examine some of the control problems that arise if joint costs are assigned by various cost accounting and some internal pricing conventions.'] ['A discussion of the relationship between the theory of games and experimental gaming is presented.

New theories, techniques and experimentation aimed at overcoming these difficulties are then discussed. The area covered is, of necessity, broad.

References are supplied for those wishing a more detailed exposition of the many topics noted here.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['Since the war, there has been a great growth in interest in the theory of organization. The size of many modern organizations has brought to the surface problems of communication and decision-making of a very different nature to those confronted by smaller groups. A large organization appears to be both quantitatively and qualitatively different from a small one. Information flows and decisions that could be comfortably handled by one "jack-of-all-trades" executive in a small organization or in a dictatorial system, where wastage may be no problem, must be broken down and handled by many specialists. In many cases they may never reach the one-man decision level but are finally acted upon by groups. The need to understand these vital processes of decision-making has impelled us to lay emphasis upon the gathering and study of information, the evaluation of goals, and the role of the individual decision-maker. The new methods of game theory appear to provide an important approach to many of the problems of decision-making. In this survey of areas of application of game theory some problems which have been completely formulated, solved, and are of immediate practical value have been discussed in Sections 4 and 5. However, for those interested in the deeper and more important long-range problems which confront the researcher in the behavioral sciences, Section 6 indicates where some of the work of yesterday has taken place and where much of the work of tomorrow must lie.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.']
