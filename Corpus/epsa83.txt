In the model economy, growth rates in technology are altered by infrequent large shocks and continuous small shocks. An investor observes movements in the technology level but cannot perfectly distinguish their sources. Instead the investor solves a signal extraction problem. We depart from most of the macroeconomics and finance literature by presuming that the investor treats the specification of technology evolution as an approximation. To promote a decision rule that is robust to model misspecification, an investor acts as if a malevolent player threatens to perturb the actual data-generating process relative to his approximating model. We study how a concern about robustness alters asset prices. We show that the dynamic evolution of the risk-return trade-off is dominated by movements in the growth-state probabilities and that the evolution of the dividend-price ratio is driven primarily by the capital-technology ratio.

Another ODE governs escape dynamics that recurrently propel away from a self-confirming equilibrium. In a model with a unique self-confirming equilibrium, the escape dynamics make the government discover too strong a version of the natural rate hypothesis. The escape route dynamics cause recurrent outcomes close to the Ramsey (commitment) inflation rate in a model with an adaptive government.

To recover a version of Barro's random walk tax-smoothing outcome, we modify Lucas and Stokey's economy to permit only risk-free debt. Having only risk-free debt confronts the Ramsey planner with additional constraints on equilibrium allocations beyond one imposed by Lucas and Stokey's assumption of complete markets. The Ramsey outcome blends features of Barro's model with Lucas and Stokey's. In our model, the contemporaneous effects of exogenous government expenditures on the government deficit and taxes resemble those in Lucas and Stokey's model, but incomplete markets put a nearunit root component into government debt and taxes, an outcome like Barro's. However, we show that without ad hoc limits on the government's asset holdings, outcomes can diverge in important ways from Barro's. Our results use and extend recent advances in the consumption-smoothing literature."] [' In this paper we study saving and pension reform in the context of general equilibrium models. We discuss some of the reasons for the existence of a social security system. We highlight the key features of the US data that a general equilibrium model of saving and social security should match: the life-cycle profiles of savings, consumption and hours worked, and the aggregate capital-output ratio and saving rate. We describe the structure of a general equilibrium model, and discuss how its parameters are estimated or calibrated from the data. We present the quantitative results from some policy experiments previously computed in the literature, first in the context of stationary demographics and then with an ageing population, and highlight the key policy prescriptions that we learn from these experiments. We conclude by providing some directions for future research.

Mints stood ready to sell (but not to buy) coins for metal. Seigniorage and brassage fees determined the spreads between mint points and melt points for each coin. Because it was cheaper to make a large coin than a smaller one, there were difficulties in aligning the mint-melt points for various coins, and these exposed the system to recurrent shortages, especially of small coins. The authors build a model of the medieval money supply system and modify a cash-in-advance model of demand to capture a preference for small change. They use the model to study the behavior of exchange rates between large and small denomination coins across periods of shortages. The authors also use the model to study how a standard formula of the nineteenth century could be used to supply small change without shortages. The standard formula displaced the medieval supply mechanism with a token currency for all coins but one.'] ['Without policy reforms, the aging of the U.S. population is likely to increase the burden of the currently unfunded social security and medicare systems. In this paper we build an applied general equilibrium model and incorporate the population projections made by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to evaluate the macroeconomic and welfare implications of alternative fiscal responses to the retirement of the baby-boomers. Our calculation suggest that it will be costly to maintain the benefits at the levels now promised because the increases in distortionary taxes required to finance those benefits will reduce private saving and labor supply. We also find that the "accounting calculations" made by SSA underestimate the required fiscal adjustments. Finally, our results confirm that policies with similar long-run characteristics have very different transitional implications about the distribution of welfare across generations.
