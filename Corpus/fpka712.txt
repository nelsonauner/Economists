The other is the notion of \xe2\x80\x98informality\xe2\x80\x99 as a central challenge for tax design and implementation. Several insights emerge. First, the results make clear that the term \xe2\x80\x98informal\xe2\x80\x99 as used in the literature is imprecise and can consequently be very misleading: the models reveal a range of compliant and non-compliant behaviors with very different welfare and revenue implications. Second, the various forms of behavior considered suggest optimal thresholds generally higher than would otherwise be the case, with quite complicated implications for the associated patterns of (non)-compliance. Third, when (as is realistic) firms and individuals face multiple tax and non-tax obligations, the setting of optimal thresholds is considerably more complex.

Although urbanization has continued at a rapid pace, formalization appears to have stalled. Women comprise an increasing share of the informal sector in many countries, but are increasingly underrepresented in the formal sector relative to their presence in the informal sector. Firm-level evidence suggests informal enterprise creation, particularly by women, has important connections to urbanization. Female-specific market access, especially to inputs, is a key factor for women-owned enterprise creation in the informal sector. Given the persistence of the informal sector, and given the importance of women-owned enterprise creation for jobs and gender equity, more policy measures focused on enhancing access to inputs for female-owned enterprises are important to maximize women\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to India\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' C21, J23, J30, J31, J38.

Due to the potential simultaneity between enforcement and compliance, the number of labour inspectors is instrumented by the number of non-inspectors. The results suggest that there are a variety of factors impacting on violation, including firm-level, sectoral and spatial characteristics.

Technical arguments suggest that finer targeting, through tightening individual programs or reallocating resources towards more tightly targeted programs, uses resources more efficiently for poverty reduction. These arguments survive even when the greater informational costs and the incentive effects of finer targeting are taken into account. But political economy arguments suggest that finer targeting will end up with fewer resources allocated to that program, and that looser targeting, because it knits together the interests of the poor and the near-poor, may generate greater resources and hence be more effective for poverty reduction despite being "leakier." Overall, the policy advice to tighten targeting and to avoid more loosely targeted programs during crises needs to be given with considerable caution. However, the advice to design transfer systems with greater flexibility, in the technical and the political economy senses, is strengthened by the arguments presented here. The case for external assistance, to design flexible transfer systems ex ante, and to relieve the painful tradeoffs in targeting during a crisis, is also shown to be strong.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['Both raw intuition and past experience suggest that the success of an employment guarantee scheme (EGS) in safeguarding the welfare of the poor depends both on the wage it promises, and the ease with which any worker can gain access.

We chart the positive and normative limits of such an EGS as an efficiency improving and poverty alleviating policy reform in a canonical labor market setting. At its core, an EGS provides an aggregate, not just EGS, employment target. Given the target, the EGS wage and access can be fine-tuned to deliver outcomes ranging from a contestable labor market to a simple universal unemployment benefit. The credibility of any such target, however, is shown to be triggered endogenously by a host of factors: the distributional concerns of the planner, private sector productivity, the prevalence of market power and the need for public works.

There is male and female specialization in activities such that the female member is involved in a community level public good. A rise in the male wage leads to adjustment of household time allocation with the male working more in the market and less on household activities. In turn, the female works more on household activities and less on the community public good, failing to internalize the negative externality imposed on other members of the community. Under quite general conditions the implied negative effect can more than offset the positive effect of the male wage raise, and the entire family is worse off.

Our conclusion is that the nominal distribution of income could give a misleading picture of tensions in society, both within and across communities. Ideologies of community solidarity may well trump those of class solidarity because of the implicit sharing of community resources brought about by community-specific public goods. Greater economic mobility of particular types may actually exacerbate class tensions instead of attenuating them.

Second, we extend the standard textbook model to allow for income-sharing between employed and unemployed persons in society. Third, we extend the basic model to deal with income sharing within families. We find that there are situations in which a higher minimum wage raises poverty, others where it reduces poverty, and yet others in which poverty is unchanged. We characterize precisely how the poverty effect depends on four parameters: the degree of poverty aversion, the elasticity of labor demand, the ratio of the minimum wage to the poverty line, and the extent of income-sharing. Thus, shifting the perspective from unemployment to poverty leads to a considerable enrichment of the theory of the minimum wage.

And yet there is evidence that growing spatial inequality may co-exist with increased migration from poorer to richer areas, at least over certain ranges. At a theoretical level, this raises the question of modeling opposing forces, for convergence and divergence, in a common framework, and identifying the precise conditions under which the tendency for convergence dominates, or is dominated by, the forces for divergence. A conventional route to introducing forces for divergence is to bring agglomeration effects into the standard setup. This paper explores an alternative route, based on a theoretical and empirical proposition of the migration literature, namely, that migration is a selective process. Focusing on skilled migration, the paper demonstrates the different forces in play that make selective migration a force for both divergence and convergence, and characterizes where each set of forces dominates. Finally, it explores the consequences for convergence of combining migration selectivity and agglomeration effects arising from migrant networks.

Although civil war adversely affects the performance of social indicators in general, poorer countries lose less, in absolute and relative terms, than richer countries. It is argued that the explanation may lie in the extent to which richer countries have better social (and economic) indicators because of more public goods, and adaptation of economic and social mechanisms to the greater abundance of public goods such as physical infrastructure. Civil war destroys public goods, and therefore damages disproportionately the countries most dependent on them. A further implication of this framework is that the post-conflict rebound in social indicators should be relatively stronger in poorer countries. The data bear out this prediction. Our results should not of course be read as implying that poorer countries need less support to avoid civil war and to cope with its aftermath. Although their losses are less, they start from a lower base; so even small declines severely impact human well-being.

When considerations from both disciplines are aligned, he explains, policy reform not only should be enacted but is also likely to be enacted. Often, though, there is no such alignment, so reforms that might improve social welfare do not succeed. Analysts, says the author, should consider past reforms from both perspectives, and should learn from history, in evaluating proposed reform -- so they can assess both the desirability and the feasibility of reform. Policy makers, on the other hand, should work toward organizing and mobilizing the gainers from reform that would advance social welfare, so that resistance to such reform by the losers can be overcome. In an example from history, the author explains that Britain's debate over the Corn Laws -- basically a device for protecting domestic production of grain from cheap imports -- dominated for more than a decade in the nineteenth century. It eventually split the Tory party. Britain's transformation from an agrarian nation to a manufacturing one spelled the decline of the power of the landed aristocracy and the ascendance of manufacturing. In the end, the Corn Laws were repealed because of the growing power of the urban masses and their employers, and the debate soon turned to protection against imports from fast-industrializing France and Germany. Such episodes from history help us understand the protection of rice in Japan today, for example, and the focus of this paper -- the past decade of reform in Ghana, and the decade that awaits.

Under certain conditions it is demonstrated - with both the unitary model of the household and with some collective models - that the relationship between household welfare and inequality within the household can have an inverted U-shape. Using two sets of calorie adequacy data from a sample of 455 households in the Philippines, a spline analysis is used to test the hypothesis that inequality within the household first increases and then decreases as per capita household total expenditure increases. The two sets of calorie adequacy data are based on repeated 24-hour recalls of dietary intake, and on calorie requirements that are unadjusted and then adjusted for individual activity patterns. Results indicate that once activity patterns are accounted for, calorie intake shortfalls are borne fairly equally within the household at all per capita household total expenditure levels.

They develop a regional price index for Cote d'Ivoire building on the strengths of two independent data sources: the Cote d'Ivoire Living Standards Survey (CILSS) and the International Comparisons Project (ICP). The CILSS collected detailed information on household incomes, spending, employment, and so on, but its coverage of prices left much to be desired. The ICP collected a wealth of information on prices across the country, but collected no information on household spending patterns or other socioeconomic data. The authors bring together these two sources to produce a regional price index that they argue is superior to previous estimates based solely on the Living Standards Survey. The procedures they follow should be of interest to practitioners faced with similar data shortcomings, particularly when working on Africa. They show this to be no mere statistical exercise. Using the new price index can have a significant effect on earlier evaluations of poverty in Cote d'Ivoire. They also use the new price information to construct disaggregated indices by commodity category and by poverty group.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"] [' The introduction of variable labor supply raises some fundamental issues in analyzing the targeting of poverty alleviation programs in developing countries. It forces a reconsideration of the standard objective function, which is based on income or expenditure and so makes no allowance for the effort made in earning that income. We show that alternative views on the appropriate valuation of effort have very different implications for commodity-based targeting rules. We also establish a benchmark for marginal effective tax rates (inclusive of benefit withdrawal) in income-tested schemes and show that indicator targeting rules may also have to be modified significantly when labor supply responses are recognized.

The poor have no incentive to earn income with 100 percent marginal tax rates, but how high or low the marginal rate of taxation should be, and how they should vary with income, is a complex issue - and opinions vary. Social security schemes that withdraw benefits represent an extremely high effective marginal tax rate; other schemes call for relatively low marginal tax rates at the bottom of the income distribution. Which tax-transfer schedule does most to reduce poverty? The issue is one of optimal nonlinear income taxation. The authors show that one of the key theoretical results of the welfarist literature is overturned: if it is desirable for everybody to work, the optimal marginal tax rate on the very poorest individuals is strictly negative. They argue that the nonwelfarist perspective points toward lower marginal tax rates in the lower part of the income distribution than does the welfarist perspective. But numerical simulations suggest that the effect is of limited quantitative significance. Using conventional functional forms and parameter values, optimal marginal tax rates on the poor are in the 60-70 percent range.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] [' The object of this paper is to investigate the implications of intrahousehold bargaining models for the behavior of intrahousehold inequality as a function of total household resources. The authors find theoretical support for Kuznets effects, i.e., a systematic pattern of inequality change as the total household resources increase. The paper also discusses some policy implications of this relationship. In particular, the authors find that bargaining models tend to lead to a greater emphasis on targeting to disadvantaged members of a household.

This is a special case of indicator targeting problems, where an upper cut off value of an indicator variable such as age is used to determine eligibility for receiving transfers. The theory is applied to age-based targeting of nutritional interventions, using individual level, intra-household survey data from the Philippines. The second objective of the paper is to provide a quantitative assessment of the value of such intra-household data in targeting -- we find that without such data the costs of mistargeting, by calculating the wrong upper age cut off, can be considerable. The third objective of the paper is to provide a quantitative assessment of the costs of assuming no leakage of nutritional supplements through intra-household reallocation, when such leakage does indeed take place. Surprisingly, we find that the targeting costs of this wrong assumption are minimal.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' Closer international integration is putting increasing pressure on existing national tax structures.

Does intra household inequality first increase, peak, and then decrease as the household becomes better off? The authors found both theoretical and tentative empirical support for this hypothesis. The policy significance of this finding is that the benefits of an increase in household well-being need not fully trickle down to the most disadvantaged members of the household. This is particularly true for the poorest households. This finding should be taken into account in the design of supplementary feeding programs.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['The two literatures on targeting and on intrahousehold inequality have developed rapidly over the past 15 years, but largely independent of each other. The literature on targeting concerns itself with the design of tax and transfer programs for poverty alleviation in the presence of limited information on who the poor are. The literature on intrahousehold inequality arose out of a dissatisfaction with"unitary"models of the household, especially in explaining inequality in consumption and achievements of different household members, even after allowing for relevant differences among them. The authors begin to forge the link between the two literatures, so they can address issues policymakers face around the world. After a brief reprise of the key features of the two literatures, they indicate how the presence of intrahousehold inequality and allocation mechanisms could affect the standard analysis of targeting theory. They conclude with a list of policy questions for further research.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] [' The object of this paper is to develop a framework in which the consequences of ignoring intrahousehold inequality in the measurement and decomposition of inequality and poverty can be assessed, and to apply this framework to a dataset from the Philippines. The conclusions are that while the measured levels of inequality and poverty could be subject to serious error (of the order of 30 percent or more), the patterns of inequality and poverty across key socioeconomic groups are not affected dramatically. The decision on whether or not to undertake costly intrahousehold orientated surveys thus depends on whether the policymaker is more concerned with errors in the levels than with errors in the patterns of inequality and poverty.

The paper provides a framework for the calculation of quantitative estimates of the impact of adjustment on poverty using household income and expenditure surveys currently available in LDCs. It proposes the use of decomposable poverty indices as a tractable vehicle for calculating the impact of adjustment on overall poverty.

The paper begins with the conceptual basis of alternative poverty lines and alternative indices. It then introduces the concept of "crossover time," the time that it would take the average poor person to cross the poverty line if his income grew at the per capita growth rate experienced in the past. For reasonable estimates this crossover time can exceed twenty years, which perhaps explains the concern with redistribution rather than a complete reliance on "trickle-down" effects. Regarding redistribution, the paper considers the question of targeting public expenditure on the poor. If large-scale means testing of individual households is administratively infeasible or too costly, policy must rely on instruments that measure the incomes of broadly defined groups. Although leakage is inevitable, how can it be minimized? The paper develops a methodology to answer this question and derives budgetary rules for poverty alleviation that rely only on information readily available in surveys of household income and expenditure. The paper also analyzes macroeconomic adjustment and poverty. The bottom line for most policies is to switch expenditure toward the traded goods sector and to reduce overall expenditure. The paper derives rules for when such a switch will increase or decrease poverty as well as for deciding which broad categories of income should bear the burden of reduction. Finally, the paper suggests areas for further research, especially through an application of the methodology developed in it to actual case studies. /// Le pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9sent article examine les \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9tudes quantitatives qui ont \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9t\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 r\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9cemment effectu\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9es sur la pauvret\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9, ainsi que diverses strat\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9gies visant \xc3\x83 y rem\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9dier; l\'auteur propose \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9galement une m\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9thode de d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9termination de l\'effet d\'un ajustement macro\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9conomique sur la pauvret\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9.
