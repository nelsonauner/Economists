In the Robinson-Chamberlin era of recognizing deviations from perfect competition, Kahn gave a new and parallel argument. Expand by subsidy industries with more than average price-and-marginal cost deviations, while contracting by taxation industries with less than average such deviation. A. P. Lerner, presuming feasibility of perfect lump-sum taxes, showed Kahn's equilibrium not to be (what is today called) Pareto-optimal. Earlier, Frank Ramsey had shown that, under feasible excise-taxing neither Lerner nor Kahn achieve the optimum.

Examples demonstrate that even when the economy is not free to wander randomly, intelligent speculation is able to whiten the spectrum of observed stock-price changes.
