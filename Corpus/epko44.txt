 [" This paper surveys the economic wreckage created by Wall Street's decision to manufacture and sell trillions of dollars of financial securities, which we now call toxic. And we call them toxic, not because they were risky, but because they were fraudulent. Rather than address the fundamental reasons the financial sector engages in malfeasance, the US government has been busy issuing its own fundamentally fraudulent securities, namely guarantees to support large segments of the financial sector were there to be major runs on the banks and other financial institutions. Fulfilling such guarantees would require printing trillions upon trillions of dollars and causing hyperinflation. The potential for such runs is very large, indeed, thanks to Uncle Sam's perilous fiscal finances. Achieving fiscal balance and financial security will require fundamental reform of America's retirement, tax, Social Security, and financial systems. These reforms, as outlined here, may strike some as radical. But what is truly radical is maintaining the policies now in place. (JEL codes: H2, H5, and G2) Copyright The Author 2010.

The paper compares achieving progressivity as part of privatization reform by a) providing a pay-as-you-go-financed minimum benefit to all agents at retirement independent of their contributions and b) matching contributions to private retirement accounts on a progressive basis. Although a pay-as-you-go-financed minimum benefit can enhance progressivity, it comes at the cost of substantially smaller long-run macroeconomic and welfare gains. The reasons are two: First, the ongoing unfunded liability to pay for the minimum benefit is roughly half of the unfunded liability of the current Social Security system. Maintaining this liability limits the effect of privatization on saving and capital accumulation. Second, the tax financing the flat minimum benefit is completely distortionary since the benefit one receives is independent of what one contributes. In contrast, matching worker's contributions on a progressive basis can achieve an equally progressive intragenerational distribution of welfare.

This paper develops a unique cohort data set to study the decline in U.S. national saving. It decomposes postwar changes in U.S. saving into those due to changes in cohort-specific consumption propensities, those due to changes in the intergenerational distribution of resources, those due to changes in government spending on goods and services, and those due to changes in demographics. Our findings are striking. The decline in U.S. saving can be traced to two factors: The redistribution of resources from young and unborn generations with low or zero propensities to consume toward older generations with high consumption propensities, and a significant increase in the consumption propensities of older Americans. Most of the redistribution to the elderly reflects the growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits. The increase in the elderly's consumption propensities may also reflect government policy, namely the fact that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits are paid in the form of annuities and that, in the case of Medicare and Medicaid, the annuities are in-kind and must, therefore, be consumed.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"] [' This paper uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to test whether risk-sharing is complete between or within American families.

We find that the 1986 Tax Reform law reduces excess burden by .85 percent of our model's economy's present value of consumption.

From the neoclassical perspective the deficit is an arbitrary accounting construct whose value depends on how the government chooses to label its receipts and payments. This paper demonstrates the arbitrary nature of government deficits. The argument that the deficit is not well-defined is first framed in a simple certainty model with nondistortionary policies, and then in settings with uncertain policy, distortionary policy, and liquidity constraints. As an alternative to economically arbitrary deficits, the paper indicates that the "Fiscal Balance Rule" is one norm for measuring whether current policy will place a larger or smaller burden on future generations than it does on current generations. The Fiscal Balance Rule is based on the economy\'s intertemporal budget constraint and appears to underlie actual attempts to run tight fiscal policy. It says take in net present value from each new young generation an amount equal to the flow of government consumption less interest on the difference between a) the value of the economy\'s capital stock and b) the present value difference between the future consumption and future labor earnings of existing older generations.

The key question stimulating this research is what is the main explanation for savings? Is it primarily accumulation for retirement as claimed by Albert Ando, Richard Brumberg, and Franco Modigliani in their celebrated Life Cycle Model of Savings? Is it primarily intentional accumulation for intergenerational transfers? Or is it primarily precautionary savings, much of which may be bequeathed because of imperfections in annuity markets? This paper examines a range of findings on the importance of intergenerational transfers. The strong conclusion that emerges from this evidence is that intergenerational transfers play a very important, if not a key, role in aggregate wealth accumulation. While intergenerational transfers figure very large in savings, the precise motivation for such transfers is unclear. Intergenerational altruism might appear the most likely candidate, but at least sane stylized facts, such as the equal allocation of bequests among children, are strongly at adds with the altruism model. Other explanations involving imperfect insurance arrangements or payments for child services do not appear capable of explaining the substantial amounts of transfers actually observed.

Analysis of the crowding-out mechanism leads immediately to defining economic deficits as redistribution toward older generations. Once one observes that such intergenerational redistribution underlies arguments about deficits, crowding out, and saving, it becomes apparent that numerous fiscal policies, none of which lead to officially reported deficits, also constitute economic deficits. Conventional accounting of U.S. deficits appears to have missed most of the significant U.S. economic deficits of the postwar period, with the exception of those currently under way. The failure of conventional accounting to provide sensible indicators of intergenerational redistribution, coupled with the intense public focus on these figures, suggests that fiscal illusion is widespread. There is a clear and compelling need to develop alternative ways of describing fiscal policy that are not sensitive to accounting conventions. Ultimately this appears to require describing the underlying budget constraints facing representative households in the economy. While empirical research has failed to distinguish among neoclassical models with respect to the concerns of crowding out, as well as between neoclassical and nonneoclassical models in general, the fault lies primarily with the data, not with the quality of the analyses. Discriminating among neoclassical models requires probing fairly subtle issues of household preferences, and sharp differentiating tests of these preferences require types of data quite different from what are now available. While empirical resolution of the crowding-out hypothesis appears off in the future, simulation analyses described here provide strong warnings about the potential long-term detrimental consequences of economic deficits. The simulations also indicate that crowding out is a slow and surprisingly complex dynamic process whose full dimensions cannot be discerned by consideration of short-term policy effects. /// L\'auteur de cette \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9tude examine les causes et les cons\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9quences des "d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficits \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9conomiques" en se pla\xc3\x83\xc2\xa7ant dans l\'optique des mod\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8les d\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9pargne n\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9oclassiques.

Le fait que la comptabilit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 publique traditionnelle ne contienne pas d\'indicateurs acceptables de la redistribution entre g\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9n\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rations, et que l\'attention du public se focalise avec intensit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 sur les chiffres des d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficits publi\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s, donne \xc3\x83 penser que l\'illusion budg\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9taire est un ph\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9nom\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8ne r\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9pandu. Il est de toute \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9vidence imp\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ratif de mettre au point d\'autres m\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9thodes d\'analyse de la politique budg\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9taire qui ne soient pas influenc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9es par les m\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9thodes comptables traditionnelles. En fin de compte, cet effort conduirait \xc3\x83 d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9crire les contraintes budg\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9taires structurelles qui s\'exercent sur un \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9chantillon repr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9sentatif des m\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9nages dans l\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9conomie. Si la recherche empirique n\'a pas su \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9tablir de distinction, d\'une part, entre les mod\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8les n\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9oclassiques quant aux pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9occupations suscit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9es par "l\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9viction" et, d\'autre part, entre les mod\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8les n\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9oclassiques et les autres mod\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8les en g\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9n\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ral, cela est imputable principalement aux donn\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9es et non pas \xc3\x83 la qualit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 des analyses. Pour faire des distinctions entre les mod\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8les n\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9oclassiques, il est n\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9cessaire d\'analyser en profondeur des facteurs relativement subtils qui influent sur les pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9f\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rences des m\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9nages. Or, pour appliquer des tests puissants qui permet- tent de diff\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rencier ces pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9f\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rences, il faut disposer de types de donn\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9es tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s diff\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rents de ceux qui sont actuellement disponibles. S\'il est vrai que l\'on ne pourra v\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rifier l\'hypoth\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8se "d\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9viction" de mani\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8re empirique que dans un avenir lointain, les analyses de simulation d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9crite dans l\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9tude donnent de s\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rieux avertissements en ce qui concerne les cons\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9quences potentiellement dommageables, \xc3\x83 long terme, des "d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficits \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9conomiques". Les simulations indiquent \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9galement que "l\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9viction" est un processus dynamique, lent et \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9tonnamment complexe, qui ne peut \xc3\x83\xc2\xaatre saisi dans toute son ampleur par le seul examen des effets \xc3\x83 court terme de la politique budg\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9taire. /// En este art\xc3\x83\xc2\xadculo se estudian atentamente las causas y consecuencias de los d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficit econ\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3micos desde el punto de vista de los modelos neocl\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1sicos del ahorro. El an\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1lisis del mecanismo de "desplazamiento del sector privado" lleva inmediatamente a definir los d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficit econ\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3micos como factor de redistribuci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n en favor de las generaciones de m\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1s edad. Una vez observado que esta redistribuci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n intergeneracional es un elemento fundamental de las discusiones en torno a los d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficit, al citado "desplazamiento" y al ahorro, resulta evidente que muchas medidas de pol\xc3\x83\xc2\xadtica fiscal, ninguna de las cuales se traduce en d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficit oficialmente declarados, tambi\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9n constituyen d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficit econ\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3micos. La contabilidad convencional de los d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficit de Estados Unidos parece haber pasado por alto la mayor\xc3\x83\xc2\xada de los d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficit econ\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3micos significativos estadounidenses del per\xc3\x83\xc2\xadodo de posguerra, con la excepci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n de los que se est\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1n incurriendo actualmente. El hecho de que la contabilidad convencional no haya ofrecido indicadores adecuados de la redistribuci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n intergeneracional, unido a la intensa atenci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n p\xc3\x83\xc2\xbablica a estas cifras, hace pensar que hay una ilusi\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n fiscal generalizada. Hay una necesidad clara y urgente de elaborar otros modos de descripci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n de la pol\xc3\x83\xc2\xadtica fiscal que no sean susceptibles a las convenciones contables. En \xc3\x83\xc2\xbaltimo t\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rmino, esto parece exigir una descripci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n de las limitaciones presupuestarias b\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1sicas con que se enfrentan las unidades familiares representativas de la econom\xc3\x83\xc2\xada. Aunque la investigaci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n emp\xc3\x83\xc2\xadrica no ha distinguido entre los varios modelos neocl\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1sicos en lo que se refiere a los aspectos del "desplazamiento", ni entre los modelos neocl\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1sicos y los no neocl\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1sicos en general, la culpa es fundamentalmente de los datos, y no de la calidad de los an\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1lisis. Para distinguir entre los modelos neocl\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1sicos hay que ahondar en cuestiones muy sutiles de preferencias familiares, y para efectuar pruebas afinadas de diferenciaci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n de dichas preferencias se necesitan datos muy distintos de los actualmente disponibles. Aunque la soluci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n emp\xc3\x83\xc2\xadrica de la hip\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3tesis del "desplazamiento" parece todav\xc3\x83\xc2\xada lejana, los an\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1lisis de simulaci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n descritos en este trabajo constituyen una advertencia suficientemente fuerte sobre las posibles consecuencias perjudiciales a largo plazo de los d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ficit econ\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3micos. De estas simulaciones se desprende tambi\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9n que el "desplazamiento" es un proceso din\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1mico lento y sorprendentemente complejo, cuyas dimensiones plenas no podemos discernir mediante la observaci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n de los efectos a corto plazo.'] ['This paper discusses recent neoclassical analyses of taxation and savings.Contrary to the popular view that fiscal policy has highly ambiguous impacts on savings, neoclassical models admit a host of policies with clear and potentially quite powerful affects on the accumulation of wealth.The paper considers four fundamental types of fiscal policies and compares their quantitative affect on savings.The essential elements of these policies involve inter- and intragenerational redistribution, marginal and intra-marginal taxation, and the level of government consumption. Conventional accounting measures of "taxes", "spending", and "deficits" provide, at best, little guide to changes in underlying fiscal instruments and, at worst, precisely opposite indicators of the direction of such changes. Indeed, the continued use of and concern with conventional fiscal measures is symptomatic of wide spread fiscal illusion.These points are developed within the context of certainty models. The paper also considers the role of fiscal policy in both mitigating and exacerbating economic risks facing the private sector. Since precaution is a major motivation for saving, governments can greatly influence wealth accumulation either by using fiscal policy to pool private risks or by making fiscal policy itself highly uncertain.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['This paper presents a new simulation methodology for determining the pure efficiency gains from tax reform along the general. equilibrium rational expectations growth path of life cycle economies. The principal findings concern the effects of switching from a proportional income tax with rates similar to those in the U.S. to either a proportional tax on consumption or a proportional tax on labor income. A switch to consumption taxation generates a sustainable welfare gain of almost 2 percent of lifetime resources. In contrast, a transition to wage taxation generates a loss of greater than ? percent of lifetime re- sources. A second general result is that even a mild degree of progressivity in the income tax system imposes a very large efficiency cost.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ["This paper uses newly available data from the Social Security Administration's Retirement History Survey to examine the adequacy of saving. This data source is particularly rich; survey data for respondents covering the ydars 1969, 197 1( and 1953 have been matched with Social Security earnings records covering the years dating back to 1951. In addition to information on the path of lifetime earnhngs, the survey contains extensive data on individual asset holdings. The evidence indicates that surprisingly few couples currantly suffer significant reductions in their standard of living in their old age. This appears due, in large part, to our compulsory savings institutions, the Social Security and private pension systems. These institutions have succeeded in redistributing the lifetime consumption of private individuals from their youth to their old age.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"] ['This paper uses historicaI U.S. data to directly estimate the contribution of intergenerational transfers to aggregate capital accumulation. The evidence presented indicates that intergenerational transfers account for the vast majority of aggregate U .S. capital formation; only a negligible fraction of actual capital accumulation can be traced u, life-cycle or "hump" savings. A major difference between this study and previous investigations of this issue is the use of more accurate longitudinal age-earnings and age-consumption profiles. These profiles are simply too flat to generate substantial lifecycle savings. This paper suggests the importance of and need for substantially greater research and data collection on intergenerational transfers. fife-cycle models of savings that emphasize savings for retirement as the dominant form of apical accumulation should give way to models that illuminate the determinants of intergenerational transfers.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['A new empirical study of the relation between money, nominal income, prices, and real output in postwar quarterly U.S. data rejects virtually all of the conclusions reached by Families provide individuals with risk sharing opportunities which may not otherwise be available. Within the family there is a degree of trust and a level of information which alleviates three key problems in the provision of insurance by markets open to the general public, namely, moral hazard, adverse selection, and deception. The informational advantages of pooling risk within families must be set against the inability of families to provide complete insurance because of the small size of the risk pooling group. This paper demonstrates how families can provide insurance against uncertain dates of death. Death risk sharing family arrangements effectively constitute an incomplete annuities market. Our analysis indicates that these arrangements even in small families can substitute by more than70% for complete annuities. Given the adverse selection problem and transactions costs in public annuity markets, risk pooling in families may well be preferred to purchasing market annuities. In the absence of organized public markets in annuities, these risk sharing arrangements provide powerful economic incentives for marriage and family formation. The paper suggests that inter-family transfers need have nothing to do with altruistic feelings; rather, they may simply reflect risk sharing behavior of completely selfish family members.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.']
