Half of humanity today lives in cities but, until the last two decades, economists have paid much less attention to cities than have other social scientists. By contrast, geographers have long studied the role of cities in human affairs. Michael Batty, a distinguished scholar in the field of human geography, has recently written The New Science of Cities, a synthesis of his work and of some other prominent urban geographers. A review of his book is the first objective of this essay. The second is to discuss and compare the tools and concepts developed by urban economists with those of urban geographers in the hope of triggering a fruitful debate between those two groups of social scientists.'] ["The paper studies a market of horizontally differentiated good under increasing return to scale and exogenous number of firms. Three concepts of equilibria are compared: Cournot, Bertrand and monopolistic competition. Under fairly general assumptions on consumer's preferences, it is shown that Lerner index is the highest in Cournot case, monopolistic competition provides the lowest one and Bertrand equilibrium takes intermediate position. When the number of firms N increases, both oligopolistic equilibria converge to monopolistic competitive equilibrium with rate 1/ N . Thus the study generalizes the similar results on markets of homogeneous goods."] ['There is a wide consensus among international institutions and national governments in favor of compact (i.e. densely populated) cities as a way to improve the ecological performance of the transport system. Indeed, when both the intercity and intra-urban distributions of activities are given, a higher population density makes cities more environmentally friendly because the average commuting length is reduced. However, when we account for the possible relocation of activities within and between cities in response to a higher population density, the latter may cease to hold. Indeed, an increasing-density policy affects prices, wages and land rents, which in turn incentivizes firms and households to change place. This reshapes the urban system in a way that may generate a higher level of pollution. Thus, although an increase in compactness is environmentally desirable when locations are given, compactness may not be environmentally-friendly when one accounts for the general equilibrium effects generated by such a policy.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ["We study urbanization and rural industrialization in a setting involving one urban region (U) and one rural region (R).

Farmers face three options: (i) working in the agricultural sector, (ii) setting up firms in R, or (iii) moving to U. There exists a unique equilibrium, which displays four different patterns. In the first one, both urbanization and rural industrialization occur simultaneously. In the second and third patterns, either urbanization or rural industrialization arises, whereas the last pattern involves an industrial core and an agricultural periphery. The conditions under which each pattern emerges are determined. The transfer of labor from the agricultural to the industrial sector always increases farmers' welfare, while the welfare impact on incumbent urban workers is ambiguous."] ['Many industries are made of a few big firms, which are able to manipulate the market outcome, and of a host of small businesses, each of which has a negligible impact on the market. We provide a general equilibrium framework that encapsulates both market structures. Due to the higher toughness of competition, the entry of big firms leads them to sell more through a market expansion effect generated by the shrinking of the monopolistically competitive fringe. Furthermore, social welfare increases with the number of big firms because the pro-competitive effect associated with entry dominates the resulting decrease in product diversity.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['This paper studies the evolution and determinants of spatial inequalities in France.

While immobile workers are employed with intermediate goods to produce the final good, mobile workers are used to design the line of differentiated intermediategood inputs. Capital is immobile, the final good is non-traded, whereas the intermediate goods are traded. We find that employment agglomeration and output growth need not be positively related.

At least two types of motivations may explain such a behavior. In some cases social pressures may lead to conformity; while in some other cases individuals may feel the need of exclusiveness under the form of vanity. Such externalities have proven to be important in several markets where the decision to buy a product is positively or negatively affected by the number of consumers purchasing the same product. However, the market and welfare implication of these effects are still unclear. To investigate them, we propose to graft the consumption externality model onto the spatial duopoly model. When conformity is present but not too strong, both firms remain in business but price com- petition is fiercer and results in lower prices. The market share of the large firm increases with the population size; as the population keeps rising, the large firm serves the entire market and sets a price which has the nature of a limit price.

Generally, decentralization leads to under-provision, which can be offset by inter-jurisdictional subsidies based on gross migration flows. But the extent of the discrepancy depends on the local balance of political forces. Indeed, when the welfare of native-born emigrants is highly valued while new immigrants carry little political weight, over-provision in equilibrium is possible.

As expected, the relative value of fixed production costs to transportation costs is crucial in the determination of facility locations. Less expected is the fairly strong instability observed in the structure of the locational pattern of facilities when the relative value of the fixed costs changes. The construction of a piece of infrastructure has an impact on the regional structure of production provided that it allows for a substantial reduction in transport spending. When scale economies in production are large, one regional center swallows up the other and may eventually become the only production center within the integrated economy.'] [" We study imperfect competition in the labor market when both workers and firms are heterogeneous.

At equilibrium, each player is using the appropriate choice probabilities, given the choice probabilities used by the others in the game. The rationality of the players is parameterized on a continuum from complete rationality to uniform random choice. Using results by McKelvey and Palfrey, we show existence of an equilibrium for any finite n-person game and convergence to Nash equilibrium.

Further, when the risk dominance criterion is used, only the former equilibrium is selected.

At the Nash equilibrium in quantity-outlay schedules, consumers buy the same quantities as they would from the same firm if it were a monopolist facing the same informational asymmetries, but they receive greater surplus. Hence, no efficiency gains result from competition. If consumers have the option to reveal their locations and have the firms deliver the goods, all consumers choose to reveal their locations in equilibrium.

Their main result is that every model belonging to a very large class of Hotelling-type models (including all the commonly used specifications) is actually a special case of a vertical product differentiation model. Formally speaking this means that the Hotelling type-model and the corresponding vertical product differentiation model are equivalent. Specifically, the authors show that the equilibria emerging in the two categories of models are identical in a well defined sense.

The intensity of this bias varies across consumers. In this context, trade arises because of the dispersion of consumers\' perception of the foreign good; when consumer attitudes are diverse enough, one firm concentrates on consumers with an intensive bias, leaving room for the other, which will serve consumers with a low bias. Next, an increase in import tariff will unambiguously lead to a general increase in price, since, in equilibrium, the domestic firm will decide to increase margins. Finally, we identify conditions under which "Buy Domestic" campaigns increase local welfare and output.'] ['Models of spatial competition have proven useful in describing differentiated product markets. A serious problem is the nonexistence of Nash equilibria. This problem is resolved by modelling the price formation process using the core. The equilibrium is the outcome of a two-stage process. In the first stage, two firms choose locations simultaneously. The second stage has prices determined by an allocation in the core of a cooperative subgame allowing for coalitions of buyers and sellers. These prices approach the competitive level as the distance between the firms goes to zero, thus capturing the essence of duopoly rivalry.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' A model of consumer multipurpose shopping is used for studying the optimality of central places. There are two different commodities sold by two different types of firms. The shopping frequencies are exogenously given and different for the two commodities. Consumers can group their purchases of the two commodities in order to reduce transport costs. It is shown that the socially optimal configuration of firms always involves the clustering of a firm type 2 (low purchase frequency) with a firm of type 1 (high purchase frequency), assuming that the number of firms of type 2 is smaller than the number of firms of type 1.

Three alternative spatial price policies are considered: (i) uniform mill pricing, in which the same price is charged to the clients at the plant door, (ii) uniform delivered pricing, in which clients pay the same delivered price irrespective of their locations, and (iii) spatial discriminatory pricing, which is such that the firm sets client-specific prices based on their locations. Computational results are reported."] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' The authors provide a comparison of three spatial price policies: uniform pricing, mill pricing, and spatial price discrimination. Profits, consumer surplus, and social surplus are compared in a duopoly model. Until recently, oligopoly analysis has been stalled because of nonexistence of equilibrium. Through the addition of product heterogeneity (using a logit specification), existence can be restored and price policies compared. In contrast to monopoly analysis, consumer surplus is highest under uniform pricing and lowest under mill pricing. Profit and social surplus follow the opposite ranking. Government regulation to encourage mill pricing may therefore benefit firms to the detriment of consumers.

We first discuss the historical and epistemological foundations of these models. The two main families are considered: models with stochastic choice rule and stochastic utility models. A detailed study of the multinomial logit is probided. Two major generalizations of this model are then presented. Finally, we deal with stochastic dependence among choices.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ["A duopoly model encompassing both horizontal and vertical differentiation is analysed. We seek subgame perfect Nash equilibria in a game where firms choose, first, the horizontal (variety) and the vertical (quality) characteristics of their product and, then, compete in prices. We show that, whatever the products' characteristics, a price equilibrium exists. In the product selection stage, firms choose maximum differentiation along one of the characteristics and minimum differentiation along the other. When the quality range is broad enough relative to the variety range, firms choose the same variety but maximise differentiation in quality. Otherwise, they both choose the maximum quality but maximise their difference in terms of variety."] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' The authors propose a specific characteristics framework in order to construct linkages between alternative approaches to modeling product differentiation. It is shown that a demand system that satisfies the gross substitutes property imposes specific requirements on the locations of products. In particular, the dimension of the characteristics space must be larger than, or equal to, the number of products minus one. The authors then identify a method for casting a given demand system into their characteristics framework. This is illustrated for the logit, probit, and linear probability models of discrete choice theory. Finally, the authors find a characteristics representation of the CES representative consumer.

The first stage determines a free-entry equilibrium using Bertrand-Nash assumptions, while the second stage deals with the collusive selection of price.

However, in the case of older towns, this instrument is inadequate since movements from one place to another can take place only through the center of the town or along a ring built around the town. The choice between these two alternative routes is made so as to minimize the total transportation cost (including time). In such cases, the circum-radial metric appears to be a suitable instrument.. In this article, the circum-radial metric is used to study the distribution of traffic along alternative routes. Differential costs and different barriers to traffic are explicitly considered."]
