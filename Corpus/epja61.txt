 ['Graphical display of regression results has become increasingly popular in presentations and in scientific literature because graphs are often much easier to read than tables. Such plots can be produced in Stata by the marginsplot command (see [R] marginsplot). However, while marginsplot is versatile and flexible, it has two major limitations: it can only process results left behind by margins (see [R] margins), and it can handle only one set of results at a time. In this article, I introduce a new command called coefplot that overcomes these limitations. It plots results from any estimation command and combines results from several models into one graph. The default behavior of coefplot is to plot markers for coefficients and horizontal spikes for confidence intervals. However, coefplot can also produce other types of graphs. I illustrate the capabilities of coefplot by using a series of examples.

In three independent experimental surveys with Swiss and German university students as subjects (two web surveys and a survey using paperand- pencil questionnaires in a classroom setting), each of the three techniques is compared to direct questioning and evaluated based on the \xe2\x80\x9cmore-is-better\xe2\x80\x9d assumption. According to our results the RRTand the ICT failed to reduce social desirability bias in self-reports of plagiarism. In contrast, the CM was more successful in eliciting a significantly higher rate of reported sensitive behavior than direct questioning. One reason for the success of the CM, we believe, is that it overcomes the \xe2\x80\x9cself-protective no\xe2\x80\x9d bias known from the RRT (and which may also be a potential problem in the ICT).We find rates of up to 22 percent of students who declared that they ever intentionally adopted a passage from someone else\xe2\x80\x99s work without citing it. Severe plagiarism such as handing in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s paper as one\xe2\x80\x99s own, however, seems to be less frequent with rates of about 1 to 2 percent.'] [" Is Benford's law a good instrument to detect fraud in reports of statistical and scientific data? For a valid test, the probability of 'false positives' and 'false negatives' has to be low. However, it is very doubtful whether the Benford distribution is an appropriate tool to discriminate between manipulated and non-manipulated estimates. Further research should focus more on the validity of the test and test results should be interpreted more carefully. Copyright 2010 The Authors.

To facilitate and automate the task of tabulating results from SPost commands for inclusion in reports, publications, and presentations, we introduce tools to integrate SPost with the estout user package (Jann, 2005, Stata Journal 5: 288 \xe2\x80\x93 308; 2007, Stata Journal 7: 227 \xe2\x80\x93 244). The estadd command can retrieve results computed by the SPost commands brant, fitstat, listcoef, mlogtest, prchange, prvalue, and asprvalue. These results can then be tabulated by esttab or estout.

For example, the technique is often used to analyze wage gaps by sex or race. This article summarizes the technique and addresses several complications, such as the identi\xef\xac\x81cation of e\xef\xac\x80ects of categorical predictors in the detailed decomposition or the estimation of standard errors. A new command called oaxaca is introduced, and examples illustrating its usage are given.

The command supports large-sample tests for complex survey designs and exact tests for small samples as well as classic large-sample Chi^2-approximation tests based on Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s Chi^2, the likelihood ratio, or any other statistic from the power-divergence family (Cressie and Read, 1984, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B (Methodological) 46: 440 \xe2\x80\x93 464). The complex survey correction is based on the approach by Rao and Scott (1981, Journal of the American Statistical Association 76: 221 \xe2\x80\x93 230) and par- allels the survey design correction used for independence tests in svy: tabulate. mgof computes the exact tests by using Monte Carlo methods or exhaustive enu- meration. mgof also provides an exact one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for discrete data.

However, its syntax is relatively complex and commands may turn out long even for simple tables. Furthermore, having to store the estimates beforehand can be cumbersome. To facilitate the production of regression tables, I therefore present here two new commands called eststo and esttab. eststo is a wrapper for official Stata\xe2\x80\x99s estimates store and simplifies the storing of estimation results for tabulation. esttab, on the other hand, is a wrapper for estout and simplifies compiling nice- looking tables from the stored estimates without much typing. I also provide updates to estout and estadd.

Because automation of these tasks is often poor, processing results produced by statistical packages is quite laborious and vulnerable to error. I will therefore present a new package called estout that facilitates and automates some of these tasks. This new command can be used to produce regression tables for use with spreadsheets, LATEX, HTML, or word processors. For example, the results for multiple models can be organized in spreadsheets and can thus be archived in an orderly manner. Alternatively, the results can be directly saved as a publication-ready table for inclusion in, for example, a LATEX document. estout is implemented as a wrapper for estimates table but has many additional features, such as support for mfx. However, despite its flexibility, estout is \xe2\x80\x94I believe \xe2\x80\x94still very straightforward and easy to use. Furthermore, estout can be customized via so-called defaults files. A tool to make available supplementary statistics called estadd is also provided.

For example, in a study on drug addiction an interview question might be, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich substances did you consume during the last four weeks?\xe2\x80\x9d The respondents just list all the drugs they took, if any; e.g., an answer could be \xe2\x80\x9ccannabis, cocaine, heroin\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cecstasy, cannabis\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnone\xe2\x80\x9d, etc. Usually, the responses to such questions are stored as a set of variables and, therefore, cannot be easily tabulated. I will address this issue here and present a new module to compute one- and two-way tables of multiple responses. The module supports several types of data structure, provides significance tests, and offers various options to control the computation and display of the results. In addition, tools to create graphs of multiple-response distributions are presented.

Particularly, labor economists are wondering how the introduction of new technologies, e.g. Personal Computers, have shaped labor markets. Former research has concentrated on the question of whether on-the-job use of PCs creates a wage bonus for employees. In this paper, we investigate whether the use of PCs increases employees\xe2\x80\x99 probability of an upward shift in their employment status and whether it reduces the risk of involuntary labor market exits. We do so by applying event history analysis to the Swiss Labor Market Survey, a random sample of 3028 respondents, and by analyzing a Panel sub-sample of 650 respondents conducted recently in Switzerland. Our results show that on-the-job use of PCs was beneficial for employees in the past by increasing their probability of an upward shift by approximately 50%. The analysis also suggests that PC use reduces the risk and duration of unemployment. However, these latter results fail to reach statistical significance.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.']
