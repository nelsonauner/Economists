We employ network analysis to address such systemic research questions, in particular: how centralized or dispersed are migration flows and how does this structure evolve over time? And, how is migration activity clustered between specific countries, and if it is clustered, do such patterns change over time? Going a step further than exploratory network analysis, in this paper we estimate international migration models for OECD countries based on a dual approach: gravity models estimated using conventional econometric approaches such as panel data regressions and network-based regression techniques such as multivariate regression quadratic assignment procedures. The empirical results reveal not only the determinants of international migration among OECD countries, but also the value of blending network analysis with more conventional analytic methods.

We find that innovation in both countries is predominantly determined by establishment size and industry. Moreover, obstacles encountered and organizational changes faced by firms drive innovation too. With respect to the composition of employment, the presence of high-skilled staff is most important. Cultural diversity of employees has a positive partial correlation with product innovation. The size and statistical significance of this effect depends on the econometric model specification and the country considered.

Since the late 1990s an increasing number of trade studies have taken infrastructure into account. The purpose of the present paper is to quantify the importance of infrastructure for trade by means of meta-analysis and meta-regression techniques that synthesize various studies. The type of infrastructure that we focus on is mainly public infrastructure in transportation and communication. We examine the impact of infrastructure on trade by means of estimates obtained from 36 primary studies that yielded 542 infrastructure elasticities of trade. We explicitly take into account that infrastructure can be measured in various ways and that its impact depends on the location of the infrastructure. We estimate several meta-regression models that control for observed heterogeneity in terms of variation across different methodologies, infrastructure types, geographical areas and their economic features, model specifications, and publication characteristics. Additionally, random effects account for between-study unspecified heterogeneity, while publication bias is explicitly addressed by means of the Hedges model. After controlling for all these issues we find that a 1 percent increase in own infrastructure increases exports by about 0.6 percent and imports by about 0.3 percent. Such elasticities are generally larger for developing countries, land infrastructure, IV or panel data estimation, and macro-level analyses. They also depend on the inclusion or exclusion of various common covariates in trade regressions.'] [' type="main" xml:lang="es"&gt;  Las ciudades no solo est\xc3\xa1n conectadas a trav\xc3\xa9s de infraestructura convencional, sino tambi\xc3\xa9n a trav\xc3\xa9s de infraestructura digital.

Even if regional indicators are not fully capable to model SH and technical amendments are required to account for unmodelled SH, the results emphasise their importance to achieve a well-specified model. Due to SH beyond the level of regional indicators, locally weighted regressions are proposed. Mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR) prevents the limitations of fixed effects by exploring spatially stationary and non-stationary price effects. Besides reducing prediction errors, it is concluded that global model misspecifications arise from improper selected fixed effects. Reported findings provide evidence that the SH of implicit prices is more complex than can be modelled by regional indicators or purely local models.

We distinguish between the effects of interactions-based productivity, consumption amenities and sorting of heterogeneous home owners while controlling for interactions between the labor and housing market. We find that an increase in the cultural diversity of the population positively impacts equilibrium wages and housing prices, particularly in the largest and most densely populated cities. This result is largely driven by spatial sorting of individuals in both the labor and housing market. After controlling for home owner heterogeneity we find that increasing cultural diversity no longer impacts local labor markets and negatively impacts local housing markets.

The consequences of traffic accidents are not only limited to road travellers (congestion, delays), but may also affect the area surrounding the incidents, for instance, the release of chemical substances. The lack of a real-time assessment of the mobility consequences of an incident, as well as of its wider consequences for the surrounding area, in terms of security and safety, hampers the decision-makers ability to respond effectively to an incident and to manage its consequences.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['A closer look at the spatial distribution of industrial sectors in a country shows that there is a persistent trend for industries to cluster in certain regions in order to benefit from agglomeration advantages. The present paper aims to gain new knowledge on agglomerations in non-Western European countries in general, and in lagging regions, in particular in central and eastern countries (CEECs) in Europe. Many transition economies provide intriguing cases from this pointof view, as for several decades they have experienced an economic development that was governed by a centralized industrialization policy. Focusing on the 2-digit industries of 268 regions during the period 2001-2007 in the EU27, this paper aims to explain the emergence of industrial agglomerations in the past years across CEECs compared with the EU15. In order to obtain a more detailed picture of the sectoral and local effects on the number of employees, a shift-share analysis was carried out. This investigation was succeeded by a regression analysis to identify the forces at work. This study allows us to trace the manner in which agglomeration forces can improve regional development within the EU.'] ['The aim of the present paper is to offer an exploratory contribution to the general debate on sustainable transport, in particular from the perspective of impact assessment of sustainable transport policy. Specifically, starting from data available from different public sources in the United States, two different types of analyses are conducted: (1) comparison of the declared short term results of the most practical policies applied (e.g. ramp metering, HOV lanes, etc.); and (2) an analysis of mobility data to interpret long term effects of policy previously and semi-unconsciously applied. In particular, the latter point has a more innovative character with respect to the former. It is based on the assumption that, specifically in the West Coast of the United States, at a local scale (e.g. states), policies that would be defined as sustainable today, have already been applied in the past.'] ["  This special issue of Spatial Economic Analysis , on \xe2\x80\x98Modelling Regional Dynamics\xe2\x80\x99, contains an interesting set of novel contributions put together by guest co-editors Peter Mulder, Peter Nijkamp &amp; Roger Stough, who have also summarized and commented on the papers below.

"] ['A rise in second-generation migrant entrepreneurs and an increasing focus on modern economic sectors have become new trends in migrant entrepreneurship in recent years. Although traditional sectors are still the most popular among the first-generation migrant entrepreneurs, because of the increasing pressure and their high competitiveness in traditional areas, nowadays new market niches are rapidly developing. While the first generation has more often become active in new areas such as the producer services sector which includes finance, insurance, real estate and business-related professional services, the second generation has contributed to the emergence of new areas of immigrant business activity such as the ICT sector and the creative industries.'] ['This paper focuses attention on a quantitative analysis of the creative sector.

Several researchers have shown an interest in analysing the dynamic adjustment processes of unemployment and the average degree of dependence of the current unemployment rates or gross domestic product from the ones observed in the past. In this paper, we present a new econometric approach to the study of regional unemployment persistence, in order to account for spatial heterogeneity and/or spatial autocorrelation in both the levels and the dynamics of unemployment. First, we propose an econometric procedure suggesting the use of spatial filtering techniques as a substitute for fixed effects in a panel estimation framework. The spatial filter computed here is a proxy for spatially distributed region-specific information (e.g., the endowment of natural resources, or the size of the \xe2\x80\x98home market\xe2\x80\x99) that is usually incorporated in the fixed effects coefficients. The advantages of our proposed procedure are that the spatial filter, by incorporating region-specific information that generates spatial autocorrelation, frees up degrees of freedom, simultaneously corrects for time-stable spatial autocorrelation in the residuals, and provides insights about the spatial patterns in regional adjustment processes. In the paper we present several experiments in order to investigate the spatial pattern of the heterogeneous autoregressive coefficients estimated for unemployment data for German NUTS-3 regions.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['This paper aims to introduce Migration Impact Assessment (MIA) as a new methodological tool to estimate the socio-economic impacts of migrants on local, regional or national economies.

Regions produce new knowledge, but only part of it is efficiently adopted in the economy; the share of efficiently adopted technology depends on cognitive capital. Our dataset is based on a panel of European regions over the period 1999 to 2006, combining data from EUROSTAT and the European Values Study (EVS). We test the hypothesis that insufficient levels of cognitive capital hamper the capability of regions to fully exploit new knowledge. Results show that a lower regional absorptive capacity increases KS towards surrounding areas, hampering the regions\xe2\x80\x99 capability to decode and efficiently exploit new knowledge, both locally produced and originating from outside.'] ["The authors provide the first theoretical analysis of a one-sector, discrete-time, Schumpeterian model of growth in a regional economy in which consumers are risk neutral, there is no population growth, monopolistic entrepreneurs produce intermediate goods, and a single consumption good is produced competitively.

The present study investigates their entrepreneurial behaviour with a particular focus on their personal and business characteristics as well as their motivations and driving forces, which all determine their entrepreneurship and their business performance. An empirical application is presented, in which the results from an in-depth interview study on second-generation Moroccan entrepreneurs are discussed. The findings of our study show that, in general, these entrepreneurs are more open and are looking for new opportunities beyond the traditional markets by using modern break-out strategies. This research helps to map out key factors that influence their entrepreneurial behaviour and activity, business entry decisions, and creative business strategies. It also identifies conditions for success and other factors that impact on the performance of ethnic entrepreneurs in the Netherlands, within the broader context of entrepreneurship. These findings are informative for various stakeholders such as other ethnic entrepreneurs, policy makers and business investors in this dynamic and promising urban business environment.'] ["The authors provide the first theoretical analysis of a one-sector, discrete-time, Schumpeterian model of growth in a regional economy in which consumers are risk neutral, there is no population growth, monopolistic entrepreneurs produce intermediate goods, and a single consumption good is produced competitively.

Modern social science research - including economic and social geography - has in the past decades shown an increasing interest in micro-oriented behaviour of actors. This is inter alia clearly reflected in spatial interaction models (SIMs), where discrete choice approaches have assumed a powerful position. This paper aims to provide in particular a concise review of micro-based research, with the aim to review the potential - but also the caveats - of micro-models to map out human behaviour. In particular, attention will be devoted to interactive learning principles that shape individual decisions. Lessons from cognitive sciences will be put forward and illustrated, amongst others on the basis of computational neural networks or spatial econometric approaches. The methodology of deductive reasoning under conditions of large data bases in studying human mobility will be questioned as well. In this context more extensive attention is given to ceteris paribus conditions and evolutionary thinking.'] ["  This paper offers a concise critical overview of Okun's Law, with particular attention for its relevance in open economic systems of regions. Based on an extensive set of economic data for Finnish regions, the existence of cointegration is tested using alternative statistical methods, viz. the residual-based test and the conditional error correction model. A novelty of the paper is to combine a method of hidden cointegrations with a method of removing cross-sectional dependence. After correcting for hidden cointegrations and cross-sectional dependence, both statistical methods used yield almost similar results and confirm the presence of cointegration for the relevant data on Finnish regions.

The study focuses on a multi-method integrated toolkit for sustainability assessment, the so-called SMILE toolkit . This toolkit is developed to provide salient features that are required for monitoring policy-making in a spatial-environmental context. The sustainable development perspective is rather difficult to operationalise due to its dynamism and its multi-dimensionality. Therefore, in this study, we aim to assess the usefulness of the SMILE toolkit for sustainable development issues on the basis of a systemic set of critical factors for sustainable development. We will demonstrate the usefulness of the toolkit in order to create awareness among policymakers on the critical factors for sustainable development in the future.'] ['With tightening budgets and increasingly critical reviews of public expenditure, there is a need for a careful analysis of the performance of public bodies in terms of an efficient execution of their tasks. These questions show up everywhere in the public domain, for instance, in the provision of medical facilities, the operation of postal services, or the supply of public transport. A standard tool to judge the efficiency of such agencies is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). In the past years, much progress has been made to extend this approach in various directions. Examples are the Distance Friction Minimization (DFM) model and the Context-Dependent (CD) model. The DFM model is based on a generalized distance friction function and serves to improve the performance of a Decision Making Unit (DMU) by identifying the most appropriate movement towards the efficiency frontier surface. Standard DEA models use a uniform proportional input reduction (or a uniform proportional output increase) in the improvement projections, but the DFM approach aims to enhance efficiency strategies by deploying a weighted projection function. This approach may address both input reduction and output increase as a strategy of a DMU. A suitable form of multidimensional projection functions is given by a Multiple Objective Quadratic Programming (MOQP) model using a Euclidean distance. Likewise, the CD model yields efficient frontiers in different levels, while it is based on a level-by-level improvement projection. The present paper will first offer a new integrated DEA tool -merging from a blend of the DFM and CD model using the Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR) method \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa1\xc3\x83\xe2\x80\x9e\xc3\x83\xc2\xac in order to design a stepwise efficiency-improving projection model for a conventional DEA.

Similar economic performance among regions can be attributed to proximity. Consequently, a proper understanding, and accounting, of spatial liaisons is needed in order to effectively forecast regional economic variables. Several spatial econometric techniques are available in the literature, which deal with the spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in geographically referenced data. The experiments carried out in this article are concerned with the analysis of the SAC observed for unemployment rates in 439 NUTS-3 German districts. The authors employ a semiparametric approach\xe2\x80\x94spatial filtering\xe2\x80\x94in order to uncover spatial patterns that are consistently significant over time. The authors first provide a brief overview of the spatial filtering method and illustrate the data set. Subsequently, they describe the empirical application carried out: that is, the spatial filtering analysis of regional unemployment rates in Germany. Furthermore, the authors exploit the resulting spatial filter as an explanatory variable in a panel modeling framework. Additional explanatory variables, such as average daily wages, are used in concurrence with the spatial filter. Their experiments show that the computed spatial filters account for most of the residual SAC in the data.'] ['Entrepreneurship has clearly evolved as a critical element in the organization and restructuring of modern economies. It has been further fostered by the deregulation and privatization process in many Western countries. In addition, governments have acknowledged and started promoting the role of entrepreneurship in stimulating economic growth and development. In recent decades, we witness an increasing importance of migrant (or ethnic) entrepreneurs, in particular in big cities in the Western world. The aim of the present study is to provide both a contextual and empirical framework for assessing the business performance of migrant entrepreneurs in major cities in the Netherlands. The study is organized as follows. After an exposition of entrepreneurship and migrant entrepreneurship, the urban orientation of this new form of entrepreneurship is highlighted.

NNs are widely used in several fields because of their flexible specification structure. Their utilization in studying/predicting economic variables, such as employment or migration, is justified by the ability of NNs of learning from data, in other words, of finding functional relationships \xe2\x80\x93 by means of data \xe2\x80\x93 among the economic variables under analysis. A series of NN experiments is presented in the paper. Using two data sets on German NUTS 3 districts (326 and 113 labour market districts in the former West and East Germany, respectively), the results emerging from the implementation of various NN models \xe2\x80\x93 in order to forecast variations in full-time employment \xe2\x80\x93 are provided and discussed In our approach, single forecasts are computed by the models for each district. Different specifications of the NN models are first tested in terms of: (a) explanatory variables; and (b) NN structures. The average statistical results of simulated out-of-sample forecasts on different periods are summarized and commented on. In addition to variable and structure specification, the choice of NN learning parameters and internal functions is also critical to the success of NNs. Comprehensive testing of these parameters is, however, limited in the literature. A sensitivity analysis is therefore carried out and discussed, in order to evaluate different combinations of NN parameters. The paper concludes with methodological and empirical remarks, as well as with suggestions for future research.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] [' Urban development combined with city expansion, has brought irreversible consequences for land use and environmental degradation. The balance between stability in urban areas and biodiversity, relates in essence to sustainability and economic development. This economic development in southern Europe is especially affected by service industries such as tourism. Preventing future damage is particularly necessary in coastal zones, where contributing factors of a human or natural nature require important strategies to be designed for regional and urban planning. The application of the spatial realities of land use within temporal dynamics allows the ex-ante assessment of spatial planning policies. The combination of economic, social, and natural consequences questions the application of complex system theory within spatio-temporal dynamics supporting regional decision making. In this context, geographic information systems, combined with spatial data inventories, are used for a systemic analysis of the dynamics of urban change within land-use dynamics and complex systems.'] [" A kg\xc3\xbcn A.

Early studies of rural development suggested that newcomer rural entrepreneurs are important agents of change and responsible for new spatial development, but more recent research has concluded that there is no difference between newcomer and local rural entrepreneurs in this respect. Much of this literature is based on qualitative ethnographic case studies. Systematic pooling and scrutinizing of the main attributes and findings of such studies enhances their comparability and permits some generalization. Newcomer and local rural entrepreneurship is therefore investigated by means of a meta-analysis of twenty-two applied studies. The statistical results show that newcomer entrepreneurs are relatively older, better educated, and develop more non-agricultural business. They appear to be predominantly attracted by a rural lifestyle. In many cases, newcomer entrepreneurs are not directly the instigators of economic development, but their contribution to physical capital formation is greater than that of the locals.

Modern telecommunication technology brings attractive tourist destinations directly into the living rooms of potential travellers, also destinations that would otherwise have been difficult to find, such as certain cultural heritage objects. In this contribution, we will address the relevance of e-services in urban cultural tourism. Its aim is to map out the relative drivers of cultural visitors to cities with a particular view on the importance of modern e-services in the tourist sector. We focus on three case-study cities: Amsterdam, Leipzig and Genoa. We use discrete choice models and factor analysis to analyse the preferences of tourists for cultural heritage and e-services. Interestingly, in all three cities, the most important group of tourists, the cultural heritage enthusiasts, are often international tourists. This stresses the importance of multilingual e-services in order to maximise their impact on cultural heritage visitors and the tourism sector in general. In addition, it is also important to note that certain e-services become more important for tourists from further away, such as online booking systems.'] [' Nowadays, e-services technology has demonstrated a pervasive character in the modern tourism industry. E-services implemented by the tourism industry, e.g., e-tourism, appeared to produce significant cost reductions and market efficiencies. Since online services are continuously accessible, time and geographic differences do not hinder the interaction between tourism service providers and their customers anymore. By using ICTs, (small) tourism organisations can enlarge their markets or operate in niche markets by serving a specific group of customers. The increased use of ICTs has thus resulted in a significant change in the structure of the tourism industry. The present paper aims to provide an overview of experiences and findings that address the socioeconomic impacts of e-services for the (cultural) tourist industry, on the basis of a systematic impact analysis. We use a SWOT approach to organise a systematic evaluation of various e-services effects, which are specifically differentiated for e-services and e-tourism (including cultural heritage) of socioeconomic importance. The main sources to identify the strengths and weaknesses of e-services are the academic and management literature that describes the experience in practice of various stakeholders.'] ["  The migration issue is a much debated subject in many developed countries. This study provides a review of the relationship between migrants and their international economic linkages. It then focuses on foreign direct investment (FDI), for both inward and outward FDI. This study aims to offer a synthesis by means of a meta-analysis of various studies, in order to test the robustness of the relationship between migration and FDI.

The search models that have been proposed to motivate Oswald\xe2\x80\x99s thesis have difficulties in providing an explanation for the reverse of the Oswald effect. The model proposed in this paper is close to the ones proposed earlier, in that it also studies search behaviour, but contains a richer set of effects of homeownership on search behaviour. In our model, homeowners may have a higher intensity of job search (and hence shorter unemployment durations) when their housing expenses are\xe2\x80\x94all other things being equal\xe2\x80\x94higher than those of tenants. Some studies have indeed found that the shorter unemployment durations occur especially among highly leveraged homeowners. We show that, in the Netherlands, many homeowners have higher housing costs than otherwise comparable tenants. The model developed in this paper is therefore able to explain the existing evidence of shorter unemployment durations for Dutch homeowners.'] ['Biodiversity has received much attention in environmental research and public policy in recent years. There is a world-wide interest in its relevance for the carrying capacity of rich but fragile ecosystems. Voices suggesting building up proper protection mechanisms for unique and scarce diversity become louder. The question emerges whether \xe2\x80\x93 and which combination of \xe2\x80\x93 ecological and economic insights can help us to identify meaningful policy options to map out proper roads towards a sustainable future. This paper surveys and highlights the potential and limitations of an ecological-economics perspective on biodiversity. Such a perspective on complex biodiversity issues, if firmly supported by modern ecological insights, can help to clarify the processes, functions and values associated with biodiversity. This study aims to offer a historical review of key ecological and economic concepts that are essential in building bridges between ecology and economics, and discusses ways to integrate them. In addition to such issues as biodiversity indices or ecosystem management principles, particular attention is given to various monetary valuation approaches and methods from the perspective of preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Furthermore, the use of ecological and value indicators in integrated economic-ecological modelling and analysis is addressed as well. Throughout the paper, several illustrative applications are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the various approaches discussed. Finally, the paper offers principles for public decision-making regarding biodiversity protection.'] [' This study aims to identify the critical factor(s) that determine the embeddedness level (EL) of rural entrepreneurs. In order to achieve this aim, existing applied studies on the embeddedness of entrepreneurs undertaken in different rural areas were systematically collected to create a database in order to provide the material for a systematic comparative analysis. This was done in order to highlight common and contrasting findings from a set of selected studies for different ELs. As many results of these studies were largely qualitative in nature and only partially comparable, a specific tool for analysing categorical data based on artificial intelligence methods, namely, rough set data analysis (RSDA), was employed. This experimental study is the first RSDA approach that compares the results of several rural case studies and infers general induction rules for the different ELs. The results of our analysis show that using and benefiting from local resources are the key factors that explain how entrepreneurs become embedded in rural areas.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['The number of immigrants across the world has doubled since 1980. The estimates of the impact of immigration on wages and employment in host countries are quantitatively small but vary widely. We summarize previous meta-analyses of the empirical literature and consider the implications for policy. We conclude that, on average, the impact on employment of the native born is smaller than on wages, while impacts are generally smaller in the US than in other countries studied to date. The variation in the estimates is related to the definition of the labour market, the extent of substitutability of foreign and native workers, and controls for endogeneity of immigrant settlement in statistical modelling. Policies enhancing labour-market flexibility, while at the same time improving immigrant economic integration, are likely to be effective in reducing transitory negative impacts.'] ['The authors analyze two hitherto little studied but salient questions concerning the trinity of asymmetric information, entrepreneurial activity, and the scope of fiscal policy in an open regional economy. First, the authors use a two-period model to analyze the contractual relationship between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists when the latter are located outside the region. Because there is moral hazard, venture capitalists do not offer entrepreneurs the first best investment contract and entrepreneurial activity is suboptimal. Second, they analyze a two-period model with venture capitalists who are now located inside the regional economy. They show that despite the existence of a credit market imperfection, because, inter alia, the regional authority (RA) does not have an informational advantage over the private sector, it is not possible for this RA to use fiscal policy to make a Pareto improving intervention in which some agents are better off and others are no worse off.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' We compare a set of econometric studies that measure the effect of net internal migration in neoclassical models of long-run real income convergence and derive 67 comparable effect sizes. The precision-weighted estimate of beta convergence is about 2.7 per cent. An increase of one percentage point in the net migration rate of a region increases the per capita income growth rate in that region on average by about 0.1 percentage points. Introducing a net migration variable in a growth regression increases the estimate of beta convergence slightly. Studies that use panel models or IV estimation methods yield smaller coefficients of net migration in growth regressions, while the opposite holds for regressions controlling for high-skilled migration.

In this paper we argue that there is not an unambiguous empirical outcome of migrant or ethnic diversity, but that it depends on the level of migrant or ethnic composition itself. A low degree of socio-economic and cultural diversity may be beneficial for neighbourhoods, whereas an excessive degree of diversity may be harmful. We test this hypothesis by (i) constructing a migrant clustering index for all neighbourhoods in the Netherlands based on a gamma index; and, subsequently, (ii) incorporating it in a regression framework to assess three relevant socio-economic outcomes: neighbourhood income, number of students, and average housing value. We show that there is apparently an optimal level of migrant clustering, and that it is remarkably robust. For the Netherlands as a whole and for the ten largest Dutch cities as well, it is striking that largely similar effects were found. Our results suggest that population composition in neighbourhoods may vary up to about 40 per cent from the national average before migrant clustering generates negative effects.'] [' In recent years, entrepreneurship among migrant minorities has increased significantly in the Netherlands. This paper addresses the key factors determining the economic position of migrant entrepreneurs in the urban economy in the Netherlands, with an application to Amsterdam. So far, little information on success conditions for migrant entrepreneurship is available, while quantitative knowledge on critical success factors (CSFs) is lagging far behind the rapid growth of migrant entrepreneurs in big cities like Amsterdam. The present study serves to fill this knowledge gap, by paying attention to the entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants, the role of their social networks, and the innovative potential of new growth markets in a modern city. In order to provide a solid assessment of CSFs for migrant entrepreneurs, and to understand business performance in a competitive urban environment, this study will investigate the entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants in Dutch cities from a micro-economic perspective. Due insight into individual entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants is needed to develop an urban business culture in which migrants are no longer a source of problems but of great socio-economic opportunities, both for the migrant groups concerned and the vitality of cities. Our research employs a comparative statistical analysis of empirical findings in the city of Amsterdam in order to map out opportunities, success conditions and bottlenecks for migrant entrepreneurs. Given our largely categorical (i.e. qualitative or soft) database, we will employ a qualitative causal pattern recognition technique, namely, rough set analysis, to systematically assess the conditions for successful entrepreneurship of migrants.

Although research on networks originated in mathematical studies dating back to the nineteenth century (or earlier), and developed further in the mid-twentieth century with contributions to graph theory, interest in its application to the social sciences is currently growing---particularly in regional science and transportation, because of the spatial relevance of networks. This paper presents a dynamic outlook for the German commuting network from the perspective of the German labor market districts. The focus of this paper is to explore how the German commuting network evolves, from two perspectives: space and connectivity. We consider home-to-work commuters moving between 439 German districts for the years 1995 and 2005. The results of the present analysis make it possible to identify, among the main German districts, the most \xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d and connected ones. These emerging districts can be considered as potential \xe2\x80\x9chubs\xe2\x80\x9d in the German commuting system---that is, as attractors from the perspective of spatial economics, and as interconnectors from the perspective of networking.'] [" Turkey is facing a slight but remarkable reversal in population flows between settlements, a movement known as 'counterurbanisation'. The aim of this paper is to investigate the new patterns of population flows linked to changes in employment. To explore these patterns, the paper focuses on the causality linkages between urban-rural migration and rural employment, with a special focus on entrepreneurship, at the NUTS II level. Data used in this study are obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute. To determine the link between counterurbanisation and entrepreneurship, a multivariate statistical technique, viz. linear regression analysis, was used. This paper is the first attempt to explore the new trends in migration and employment in Turkey while offering a contemporary context for the different patterns of causal relations between counterurbanisation and entrepreneurship.

It highlights the use of e-services as a central instrument in a competitive tourist sector. The appropriate choice of e-services - and packages thereof - depends on the various strategic considerations of urban stakeholders (agents) and may differ for each individual city. The paper offers a systematic analysis framework for supporting these choices and deploys multi-criteria analysis as a systematic evaluation methodology, in particular the Regime method. The evaluation framework is exemplified through an application to three field cases in Europe, viz. the cities of Amsterdam, Genoa and Leipzig. Our analysis concludes that tailor-made packages of e-services that serve the needs of the stakeholders can be made with the help of our evaluation tools.'] ['The aim of the present paper is to design a choice model for agricultural land use, in which the demand for both nutrients and bio-fuels is taken into consideration. To that end, we employ an AEM (Agricultural Economy Model) as part of a broader integrated environmental sustainability system. The AEM model in the present paper is oriented towards an application to agricultural land use in Japan.

In this approach, a generalized distance function, based on a Euclidean distance metric in weighted spaces, is proposed to assist a decision making unit (DMU) to improve its performance by an appropriate movement towards the efficiency frontier surface. A suitable form of multidimensional projection function for efficiency improvement is given by a Multiple Objective Quadratic Programming (MOQP) model. The paper describes the various steps involved in a systematic manner. The above-mentioned DFM model is illustrated empirically by using a data set on 30 European airports, where the aim is to present a comparative analysis of the efficiency of operational management in these airports. In addition, the comparative analysis of these airports is able to assess both input slacks and output slacks (or a combination of input reduction and output rise).'] ['The evaluation of real estate assets is currently one of the main issues addressed by territorial marketing strategies with a view to developing competitive cities.

The paper is based on a comparative assessment of available quantitative data and qualitative information derived from a broad review of findings from previous studies in the literature. Our quantitative evaluation includes the European OECD countries, while our qualitative investigation addresses migrant entrepreneurship experiences in eight European countries: Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, and the UK. The results of our comparative analysis show that the general picture of European migrant entrepreneurship is determined by some distinct push factors such as high unemployment rates and low participation rates or low status in the labour market as well as by an accompanying factor, namely mixed embeddedness. The results of our comparative evaluation are summarized in a systematic typological table. These show that, while an informal and labour-intensive sector, an underground economy, and small companies and traditional households prompt migrant entrepreneurship in Southern European countries, an over-representation of non-Western immigrants among the self-employed, as well as relatively lower income levels of self-employed immigrants compared to both self-employed natives and employed immigrants are decisive for migrant entrepreneurship in Northern European countries.'] [" The present paper aims to investigate the role of creative practices for settlements, with a special focus on the 'Associations of the Most Beautiful Villages' in France and Italy.

Data and information used are derived from in-depth questionnaires filled out by relevant experts from 32 villages. In order to achieve this aim, a multivariate statistical technique, viz. logistic regression, is deployed. The study presents the preliminary results of the analysis on the roles of non-profit organisations in the marketing of settlements regarding their performance in terms of creativity, innovativeness and competitiveness.

In addition, the application of such analyses to rural regions may lead to misrepresentation or misunderstanding of rural creative capacity. Against this background, the aim of the present study is to integrate the existing literature on different components of creative capacity, namely, knowledge, innovation, entrepreneurship and networks, in order to build a more comprehensive framework for rural creative capacity and its evaluation. In the light of the perspective from the empirical literature review on the evaluation of creative capacity in rural regions, various empirical measurements seem to misrepresent or underestimate the creative capacity of rural regions. Therefore, there is a clear need to use the locality in relation to its dynamics, i.e. tacit knowledge, cultural heritage and social and physical environment as the main and basic measurement unit for creative capacity analysis.'] ['This paper aims to map out various research and policy challenges inherent in the need to cope with climate change.

When this regulatory threshold is reached, a polluting firm must move its on site waste to an off site recipient. In this setting, we analyse two questions in a stochastic framework from the viewpoints of a waste generator and a recipient that have received scant theoretical attention in the literature. First, given that off site storage is costlier than on site storage, we derive the long-run average cost incurred by a waste generating firm that stores waste both on and off site. Second, we compute the expected amount of time until the off site recipient's waste storage facility is full."] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' The modern growth literature pays much attention to innovation and knowledge as drivers of endogenous developments in a competitive open economic system.

On the premise that the analysis of a region\xe2\x80\x99s performance cannot be limited solely to either economic or social aspects, the paper attempts to combine the material (i.e. economic) and immaterial (i.e. social) aspects of welfare and wellbeing in an integrated logical scheme. In this scheme the economic aspects of living standards are represented by various categories of consumption expenditure, whilst the social aspects are represented by appropriate indicators of health, education, labour market conditions, etc. The framework proposed is also appealing for convergence analyses over time. From a time perspective, introducing this joint socio-economic concept into the analysis of differences among countries allows one to disentangle the notion of convergence into its economic and social dimensions. An empirical analysis is conducted on the Italian regions for the period from 1980 to 2005. The empirical results obtained by Principal Component Analysis show that, on average, a high level of economic welfare may contrast with a high level of social well-being.

Based on a simplified representation of a linear urban economy, a general-equilibrium model is designed and its properties are investigated by using numerical simulations. The model includes a spacious industrial centre, in which agglomeration externalities are differentiated over space, and a residential area that suffers from pollution, which is also differentiated over space. For the sake of simplicity urban environmental externalities are analyzed as being proportional to fossil fuel use, so that energy taxes would be a logical instrument. Environmental technology choice by firms is used as a tool for coping with environmental externalities, and is endogenized.

This implies a linear relationship between the price elasticity of total fuel demand and the price elasticities of fuel efficiency, mileage per car and car ownership. In this meta-analytical study we aim to investigate and explain the variation in empirical estimates of the price elasticity of gasoline demand. A methodological novelty is that we use the linear relationship between the elasticities to develop a meta-analytical estimation approach based on a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model with Cross Equation Restrictions. This approach enables us to combine observations of different elasticities and thus increase our sample size. Furthermore, it allows for a more detailed interpretation of our meta-regression results. The empirical results of the study demonstrate that the SUR approach leads to more precise results (i.e., lower standard errors) than a standard meta-analytical approach. We find that, with mean short run and long run price elasticities of - 0.34 and - 0.84, respectively, the demand for gasoline is not very price sensitive. Both in the short and the long run, the impact of a change in the gasoline price on demand is mainly driven by responses in fuel efficiency and mileage per car and to a slightly lesser degree by changes in car ownership. Furthermore, we find that study characteristics relating to the geographic area studied, the year of the study, the type of data used, the time horizon and the functional specification of the demand equation have a significant impact on the estimated value of the price elasticity of gasoline demand.'] ['The increasing proportion of immigrants in the population of many countries has raised concerns about the \xe2\x80\x98absorption capacity\xe2\x80\x99 of the labour market, and fuelled extensive empirical research in countries that attract migrants.

The data available to compute regional forecasts are usually a pseudo panel of a limited number of observations over time and a large number of regions strongly interacting with each other. Traditional time-series techniques applied to distinct time series of regional data are probably a suboptimal forecasting strategy. Although both linear and nonlinear models have been applied and evaluated to forecast socioeconomic variables, spatial interactions among regions are often ignored. This article evaluates the ability of spatial error and spatial lag models to correct for misspecifications due to neglected spatial autocorrelation in the data.

Many visions of, and speculations on, an increased footlooseness of companies and a concomitant dispersal of urban economic activity have been published in recent years. To identify whether urban agglomeration economies (in particular, knowledge spillovers) are still a key force in preventing such dispersal, we investigate the degree of footlooseness of young, innovative companies.

On the basis of these results, we argue that agglomeration economies still remain important for various categories of young, innovative, firms, even those providing ICT services, but that we need to make a distinction between agglomeration economies that work exclusively in the largest city (that is, Amsterdam) and agglomeration economies that cover a larger metropolitan area. The only fundamental change in proximity needs among these young, innovative companies originates from a small class of \xe2\x80\x98network companies\xe2\x80\x99, which are footloose even beyond the larger metropolitan area.

Using information on firms' recruitment behavior in the United Kingdom, this paper shows empirically that the applicants' journey-to-work time induces firms to offer these benefits to job applicants.

Neural networks are modern statistical tools based on learning algorithms that are able to process large amounts of data. Neural networks are enjoying increasing interest in several fields because of their effectiveness in handling complex data sets when the functional relationship between dependent and independent variables is not specified explicitly. The present paper compares two NN methodologies. First, it uses NNs to forecast regional employment in both the former West and East Germany. Each model implemented computes single estimates of employment growth rates for each German district, with a 2-year forecasting range. Next, additional forecasts are computed, by combining the NN methodology with shift-share analysis (SSA). Since SSA aims to identify variations observed among the labour districts, its results are used as further explanatory variables in the NN models. The data set used in our experiments consists of a panel of 439 German (NUTS 3) districts. Because of differences in the size and time horizons of the data, the forecasts for West and East Germany are computed separately. The out-of-sample forecasting ability of the models is evaluated by means of several appropriate statistical indicators.

Quarterly Journal of Economics 118"4": 1335-1374" noted that the estimated effect of immigration on the wage of native workers varies widely from study to study and sometimes even within the same study. In addition, these effects cluster around zero. Such a small effect is a rather surprising outcome, given that in a closed competitive labour market an increase in labour supply may be expected to exert a downward pressure on wages. We revisit this issue by applying meta-analytic techniques to a set of 18 papers, which altogether generated 348 estimates of the percentage change in the wage of a native worker with respect to a 1 percentage point increase in the ratio of immigrants over native workers. While many studies in our database employ US data, estimates are also obtained from Germany, The Netherlands, France, Norway, Austria, Israel and Australia. Our analysis shows that results vary across countries and are inter alia related to the type of modelling approach. Technical issues such as publication bias and quality of the estimates are addressed as well.

Therefore, we construct a dynamic and stochastic model of antibiotic or pesticide use to investigate the relative merits of two kinds of treatment options for overseeing the problem of resistance. In particular, we identify a likelihood function and then, inter alia, we show that this function has an important bearing on how we might best address the problem of resistance.

The existing empirical evidence, mainly based on US data, generally finds a positive correlation between sectoral specialisation and labour market indicators such as wages and unemployment. The policy implication one can draw from these results is that fostering sectoral diversification may reduce unemployment. However, this lesson may not hold for all countries. In particular, in the case of Europe, the diversity of labour market institutions may play a distinct role in shaping the relationship between sectoral specialisation and labour market performance.

Meta-analysis is then used to investigate the variation in willingness to pay (WTP) estimates for reduced pesticide risk exposure. Our findings show that the WTP for reduced risk exposure is 15 per cent greater for medium, and 80 per cent greater for high risk levels, as compared with low risk levels. The income elasticity of reduced pesticide risk exposure is generally not significantly different from zero. Stated preference approaches based on choice experiments and revealed preference provide lower WTP estimates than contingent valuation techniques. Survey design, type of safety device (eco-labelling, integrated pest management, or bans) and chosen payment vehicle are important drivers of the valuation results.

For many countries, an inverse relationship between wages and local unemployment rates has been found. In their book, The Wage Curve, Blanchflower and Oswald argued that the unemployment elasticity of pay is around - 0.1 in most countries. In a 1995 literature survey, Card referred to this striking empirical regularity as being close to an 'empirical law of economics'. Nonetheless, reported elasticities do vary, even excluding outliers, between about - 0.5 and + 0.1. There is also considerable heterogeneity among wage curve studies in terms of data and model specification. This paper carries out meta-analytic techniques on a sample of 208 elasticities derived from the literature to uncover the reasons for the differences in empirical results across studies. Several causes of variation are identified. There is also clear evidence of downward publication bias. In addition, many reported t-statistics are biased upwards due to the use of aggregate unemployment rates. A maximum likelihood method and a trimming procedure are used to correct for these biases. Both methods give similar results for our sample. An unbiased estimate of the wage curve elasticity at the means of study characteristics is about - 0.07.

Two carriers are assumed here, which are allowed to play three different strategies: point-to-point (PP), hub-and-spoke (HS) or multi-hub. We find two main stable outcomes, which depend on the size of the internal market. First, when the internal markets are small, PP network strategies are played by both carriers, while for a specific subset of parameters a collusive equilibrium in a HS configuration can be derived. Second, when the size of the internal markets is large, asymmetric configurations, where one carrier chooses a HS strategy and the other chooses a PP strategy, are the only stable equilibria. The result can be used to describe the coexistence of alternative business models that have recently emerged in the aviation industry: the established full-service model based on the HS system and the recent low-cost model based on the PP system.'] [' Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has become an important tool to promote a variety of public goals and policies. In the past years much attention has been given to the expected social benefits from deploying ICTs in different urban fields (transportation, education, public participation in planning, etc.) and to its potential to mitigate various current or emerging urban problems. The growing importance of ICTs in daily life, business activities, and governance prompts the need to consider ICTs more explicitly in urban policies. Alongside the expectation that the private sector will play a major role in the ICT field, the expected benefits from ICTs also encourage urban authorities to formulate proper public ICT policies.

The growing importance of ICT in daily life, business activities and governance prompts the need to consider the role of ICT more explicitly in urban administrations and policies. What are the city-makers' expectations of ICT? And how do they assess the future implications of ICT for their city? An analysis of these questions is needed to provide us with a better understanding of the extent to which urban authorities are willing to invest in, and to adopt, ICT policy. This paper offers both a conceptual and an operational model that aims to map out the causes and implications of ICT perceptions and views of urban policy-makers and/or administrative officials (denoted as urban front-liners). This is followed by the presentation of an operational path model-i.e. a linear structural equations model (Lisrel). The model serves to describe and test the relationships between perceptions of the city, policy-makers' beliefs about ICT and the associated urban ICT policy. According to the model, respondents who perceive their city as having many urban functions (such as commercial centre, service centre, higher education centre) have more awareness of various ICT tools and are likely to consider a multiplicity of ICT measures as relevant to their city. Respondents who consider their city as having severe bottlenecks (such as traffic congestion, housing shortage) are less likely to think of ICT measures and ICT-related goals as relevant to their city, and nor do they think that the municipality impacts significantly on ICT in the city. Furthermore, respondents who perceive their city as suffering from many socioeconomic problems (unemployment, ageing population, industrial decline and so on) are likely to consider many ICT tools as relevant to their city, although they have a low awareness of the specific tools to be deployed. Finally, respondents who believe that ICT will significantly (and positively) affect the city and its administration also tend to believe that the municipality has a high municipal influence on ICT and consider many ICT initiatives as relevant to their city."] [' This paper aims to compare the descriptive and predictive power of two classes of statistical estimation models for multimodal network flows, viz. the logit model and the neural network model.

It starts with a review of two difficulties associated with urban economics models: the empirically falsified prediction of the relation between commuting time and income, and the presence of substantial excess commuting. Notwithstanding these anomalies, research that focuses directly on the value of travel time provides evidence that there is substantial resistance against commuting among large groups of workers. However, commuting costs are just one among many other explanatory variables for actual commuting behavior, and commuting itself has become much less onerous over time. This suggests that commuting costs play a much more limited role than has been assumed in the past. On the other hand, empirical evidence suggests that space is more important than one would be inclined to think on the basis of the considerations just given. These empirical regularities suggest that other space-related aspects of the functioning of urban labor and housing markets are more important than was previously thought.

Our research project contains findings from empirical fieldwork among Turkish entrepreneurs in the Greater Amsterdam area. First-generation ethnic entrepreneurs appear to be more motivated by discrimination, problems with the transferability of their diplomas, and the goal of obtaining status, compared with their second-generation counterparts. The latter group derives more motivation from blocked promotion to start their own businesses. We found no other differences between these groups in their motives for starting up, that is, unemployment; need for achievement; making use of market opportunities; striving for independence; and using their own special talents. The reasons for finding fewer differences than expected between the two generations are discussed extensively in our paper. Having shown what the differences are between the two generations, we are able to sketch the contours for a new support policy for ethnic entrepreneurs. This new support policy is based on the need to pay attention both to the motives for starting up business and to the necessary preparatory activities.

The concept of an ecological footprint is intriguing and has prompted an avalanche of theoretical and applied research. In recent publications both the scientific basis and the policy relevance of this concept have been given ample attention, while also much empirical work has been undertaken to assess the value of the ecological footprint in different regions or countries of the world. The paper starts with a concise critical overview of the current discussion on ecological footprints. Its main aim, however, is to provide a meta-analytic assessment and interpretation of the various empirical findings in the recent literature that offer estimated values or ranges of the ecological footprint indicator. The sensitivity of ecological footprints for the stringent assumptions made in the calculation schemes is investigated using frequency analyses, cross- tabulation methods and decision-tree induction methods (a recent technique based on pattern recognition methods). The results show that methodological choice, geographical scales and year of data collection offer a significant explanation for variations in results.

In the container terminal handling market, quality is important in attracting and retaining customers. Meeting customer needs and delivering high quality for low costs are critical factors for terminals to be successful. Container transport companies are interested in speed and reliability. The time a ship or barge stays in a port must be minimised, and, therefore, the handling of containers must be executed in a fast and reliable way. The operations at the terminal, after the handling of the containers on and off the ship, must be reliable as well. Quantitative information on container terminal quality is hard to obtain. Container terminals are monitoring their quality levels, but the results are not publicly available. Therefore, a literature survey forms the main input for this paper combined with interviews with terminal operators. The aim of this paper is to offer an operational approach for the measurement of the quality of container terminal services. The central research question is: which are critical performance conditions in terms of quality for container terminals? For the container terminal sector in Europe, reliability is now the number 1 quality aspect in their transport services (including container terminal handling). Quality levels must meet high standards set by container carriers. Costs, incurred by better quality performance cannot be recovered through higher rates. Reliability, in terms of meeting container carriers\xe2\x80\x99 demand, is thus a critical performance condition for maritime container terminals. An external performance improvement characteristic might be flexibility. Deep-sea ship arrivals are no easy planning task, as weather influences and other problematic developments make the terminal operator\xe2\x80\x99s task more difficult. Through strict contracts, all risks of delays and terminal berth congestion are passed onto the terminal operator. This makes flexibility a critical performance condition. A critical performance condition for continental terminal operators is a total service.'] ['Goods are often allocated publically by means of queuing processes in developing countries. In such situations, which group of citizens should a corrupt government official favor? In addition, what should be the basis for this favoritism? To the best of our knowledge, these salient questions have received scant attention in the literature. Consequently, we use queuing theory to first demonstrate that when allocating goods publically, a case can be made for favoring a particular group of citizens. Next, we show that the nature of this favoritism depends not only on the bribes received by the corrupt government official but also on the efficiency with which this official discharges his duties.'] ['In this paper we argue that European airports, on average, are inefficient. Airline inefficiency (low load factors) appears to contribute significantly to airport inefficiency in terms of air passenger movements. We find that the average airport in Europe operates under constant returns to scale in "producing" air transport movements and under increasing returns to scale in producing passenger movements. These operating characteristics are statistically tested in a stochastic frontier model. Using data envelopment analysis, in which the number of runways is used as a fixed factor, technical and scale efficiency coefficients have been assessed. There appears to be no region-specific effect in that an airport in a certain country or region is on average more (in)efficient.'] [" N IJKAMP P.

This trend, which has become a prominent one in North America, is also increasingly observed in several European countries (e.g. France and Germany).

Analytical research into the nature (with a main distinction according to run and fun shopping) and the spatial market area of a particular shopping centre located in Greater Rotterdam (Alexandrium) shows that the anticipated policy goals are met, in the sense that the shopping mall concerned turns into a regional market for run shopping purposes rather than into a competing fun shopping centre.

The main emphasis in SOC is on the analysis of the impact of slow exogenous forces in combination with strong localised interactions between single elements or components of the systems concerned, with particular regard to the attainment of a critical state at the macro-level. Against this background, SOC serves to identify the critical conditions from the internal dynamics of the systems that lead to major and significant transformations of their behaviour. The present paper aims to offer insights and reflections originating from the SOC concept, as well as to explore its potential contribution to understanding the evolution of regional economic patterns, in particular the functioning of regional labour markets. In our study, the evolutionary dynamics of employment at a district level in West Germany as well as in the combined West and East German setting will be investigated, in order to detect the possible existence of a power law distribution of growth rates, which may be seen as an indication for SOC at the macro-economic level.

The economic evaluation of this policy change has generally shown favourable outcomes in terms of consumer welfare. These welfare effects may be termed market internal effects, as they reflect the welfare consequences of transactions that take place in the market. However, aviation typically affects welfare through both market internal and external effects: these external effects usually take the form of external costs resulting from aircraft noise, emission of pollutants and accidents. This is true for both regulated and deregulated markets, but the importance of the external costs relative to the welfare total is likely to differ between regulatory regimes. This article seeks to analyze how the presence of external costs affects the welfare effect of the liberalization of airline markets. As the size of external costs in an airline market is largely determined by the number of landings and take-offs, a spatial competition model that explicitly determines the frequency choice by airlines in symmetric equilibria is the basis of the analysis."] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ["Information and communication technology (ICT) is widely accepted as a potentially favourable set of instruments, which may improve the welfare and competitiveness of nations and cities. Nowadays, both public and private actors aim to exploit the expected benefits of ICT developments. The authors seek to investigate the potential of ICT use at an urban level and, in particular, to shed more light on various factors that influence urban ICT policies in the public domain. First, a conceptual framework, designed to improve understanding of the driving forces of urban ICT policies, is outlined. It focuses on the way decisionmakers perceive their city, and shape their opinions about ICT; it addresses in particular the way these decisionmakers evaluate the importance of ICT for their city. Next, interviews with urban decisionmakers in different European cities in three countries (Austria, Spain, and the Netherlands) are used to analyse the complex relationship between perceived urban characteristics (for example, nature of problems and urban image), personal attitudes towards ICT, administrative features of the cities concerned, and perceptions of the relevance of ICT to the cities. The authors' main focus is on the identification of a possible systematic relationship between the aforementioned explanatory factors and urban decisionmakers' attitudes towards ICT policies. Understanding the decisionmakers' perceptions is an important step towards grasping the nature and substance of the policy itself, and may explain some of the variance among different cities. Because the 'urban ICT' discourse is still relatively new, an open-interview method is used to capture a variety of different views and perceptions on ICT and on the information age in the city. With the aid of qualitative content analysis, the interview results are transformed into a more systematic and tlsb&gt;comparable form. The results suggest that even interviewees from the same city may have a different understanding of their urban reality whereas, on the other hand, cities with different characteristics may appear to suffer from similar problems. Moreover, the authors found a wide range of attitudes toward ICT and its expected social impacts, although most of the interviewees appeared to be more sceptical than had been expected. The authors identified a clear need for a more thorough investigation of background factors and, therefore an approach originating from the field of artificial intelligence -- rough-set analysis -- was deployed to offer a more rigorous analysis.

We use these measures in simulations of events that influence the level of competition, such as growing market shares, entry and merger. We find that there are events where different measures lead to different outcomes, not only in magnitude but also in sign. Competition indicators should be used with caution and attention should be devoted to the definition of the market and the importance of imperfect substitutes. The simultaneous use of several indicators, along with economic intuition and common sense reduces the risks involved.'] [' In this paper, we analyse to what extent benchmarking is a valuable tool in strategic energy policy analysis.

The focus of the research is on variations in success across three ethnic groups in the Amsterdam area. By means of structured personal interviews with many ethnic entrepreneurs, a systematic qualitative data base was created. The paper sets out to identify empirically the driving forces for business success, such as education or the role of informal networks. The explanatory framework deployed for the identification of these qualitative success factors for distinct ethnic groups is based on a particular, recently developed artificial intelligence method, viz. rough set analysis. This multidimensional classification approach appears to be able to identify various important factors for the motivation and performance of ethnic enterprises.

Rising incomes, more leisure time, new technologies and the ageing of the population are just a few examples of trends that will influence the future development of the transport sector in terms of both passenger and freight transport. This means that the future of the transport sector is characterized by uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to map out the possible impacts of current globalization trends on the European transport sector in terms of transport flows and carbon dioxide emissions by means of a novel multilayer assessment model. By applying a scenario approach and designing four contrasting development paths seen from a European perspective, the alternative futures of the sector are assessed in terms of transport volumes and emissions. The empirical findings appear to result almost everywhere in a (strong) growth of transport and emissions. Hence, the intriguing research question is now whether the introduction of specific environmentally benign policies in Europe could change this development. Consequently, the paper confronts the foreseen EU objectives with current policies, as creating sustainable mobility is a key element in EU transport policy. Our findings indicate, however, that the achievement of sustainable mobility is rather problematic. Effective policy implementation and (as yet uncertain) new technology developments may offer new opportunities to achieve a more balanced development of the transport sector. However, in most cases, only a combination of strict environmental policies (including transport policy) and a fundamental change of lifestyles in the mobile society is likely to lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions in the next 20 years.'] ['The authors extend previous literature on variations in mobility rates across local housing markets by examining the linkage of mobility rates at the household level to the structure of local housing markets. The results suggest that residential mobility rates differ widely across local housing markets, substantiating the view that residential relocation is intimately intertwined with conditions at the local level. Local housing-market conditions also have different effects on mobility rates for renters and owner-occupiers. The results suggest that variation in residential mobility rates across housing markets can be in part explained by level of urbanization, the tenure structure, the degree of government intervention, and the size of the housing market. Remarkably, these differences in local housing markets cannot be seen to be related to housing-market features only. The results suggest that these differences can also be attributed to the behavior or attitude of households with respect to housing.'] ['The demand for air transport is largely determined by the spending capacity of customers.

The moving behavior of households is described as a stochastic dynamic process in which households' moving decisions depend on information which is obtained over time. Households move when the offer exceeds an endogenously determined threshold. On the basis of the households' moving behavior, the steady-state distribution of households over the housing stock is obtained. On the supply side of the market, landlords are looking for households to occupy their vacant dwellings. Their strategy is to set rents in a mixed strategy in order to profit from imperfect information. After formulating search behavior of households as well as the behavior of landlords, the market equilibrium is derived. We explore the sensitivity of the equilibrium to changes in the structural parameters.

The paper describes the pathway to a more institutional multi-actor mode of urban land-use and revitalisation projects within the framework of deregulated land markets and maps out various relevant aspects of competitive land use. In particular, an attempt is made to identify the crucial `drivers' of this complex decision-making process in an urban context, against the background of revitalisation objectives for modern cities.

However, there are still distinct aspects that often make investment in transport infrastructure unattractive to private parties. This paper elucidates the characteristics of investments in infrastructure in general, with the aim to clarify the hesitation of private investors. One specific category of infrastructure investments, viz. container terminals, is discussed here as an interesting case. European container terminals are mostly financed with a strong involvement of private parties. From a comparative study between investments in container terminals and other investments in infrastructure, we argue that the terminal market has several features (such as imperfect competition), which lead to a lower risk for private parties. Because of these characteristics, public-private partnerships occur rather often and seem to be attractive. A situation of a fully competitive terminal market without government intervention is in the long-run possible and clearly more realistic than in other infrastructure markets. It should be realised however, that a common European policy is required to avoid distortion of competition among ports due to different subsidy regimes.International Journal of Maritime Economics (2002) 4, 1\xe2\x80\x9320 doi: 10.1057/palgrave.ijme.9100029'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['Price elasticities of transport demand are an important tool toassess the impacts of pricing policies.

A critical question, however, is whether firms provide sufficiently reliable data to enable them to make plausible forecasts at the meso (regional or sectoral) level. This paper analyses Dutch investment forecasts at different levels of aggregation. The central research question is whether entrepreneurs, individually or as a group, make systematic errors in their investment forecasts. A statistical test reveals that investment forecasts are not biased at the aggregated (regional and sectoral) level. At the micro level, however, there is a significant bias. Hence, using aggregated (regional and sectoral) data to test the lack of bias (unbiasedness) of forecasts may lead to the wrong conclusions. Moreover, aggregated investment forecasts may then be an inappropriate source for policy recommendations, despite their seemingly high reliability. This finding may in principle be valid for many European countries, since data collection on investment is organized in similar ways throughout Europe.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' This paper analyses the relationship between spatial dynamics of firms and employment growth in the region.

To this end, a novel conceptual theoretical framework based on the so-called flow approach, is developed, through which the relationship between spatial dynamics of firms (entries, exits and relocations) and changes in regional employment (job creation and job destruction) can be systematically analysed. Moreover, it also allows us to assess the generative employment effects of firm moves from and to (newly created) industrial sites in the region.

It aims to offer both a general analysis framework and a test on innovation data from several European cities. This framework is mainly built on the product life-cycle and the incubation approach. On the basis of this framework, it is argued that the phases of an industrial life-cycle have several firm-specific effects. First, these phases influence innovativeness and thus profit levels, output and employment of firms in a spatially distinct way. Second, the phases of the life-cycle mirror the importance of local factors for innovations, and third, they affect strategic decisions of firms, inter alia by influencing the source of the competitive edge. Furthermore, this paper also aims to model effects of relevant local factors on innovativeness bymeans of logit analysis, subsequent to a qualitative impact approach based on the recently developed rough set analysis. Our empirical results from various European cities show that the successive phases of the industrial life-cycle tend to create spatially recognizable impacts on innovativeness of firms.Accordingly, the evolution of the importance of local factors for innovations is also found to reflect a distinct time path. Among more than 20 local factors, the interviewed firms appear to consider support measures for skills training particularly important for innovations. Accordingly, the results of our logit models reveal that in particular skills training links with a local university contribute significantly to the propensity to innovate.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['Using data envelopment analysis, efficiency ratios for European airports are determined.

At least some European carriers charge significant premiums for direct flights from their hubs. We find that at least part of these premiums can be attributed to market power.

This can be explained partly by the recognition of the limitations of conventional equilibrium models in complex situations, and also by the easy availability and accessibility of sophisticated computational techniques. Among the class of nonlinear models, dynamic variants based on, for example, chaos theory stand out as an interesting approach. However, the operational significance of such approaches is still rather limited and a rigorous statistical-econometric treatment of nonlinear dynamic modeling experiments is lacking. Against this background this paper is concerned with a methodological and empirical analysis of a general misspecification test for spatial regression models that is expected to have power against nonlinearity, spatial dependence, and heteroskedasticity. The paper seeks to break new research ground by linking the classical diagnostic tools developed in spatial econometrics to a misspecification test derived directly from chaos theory-the BDS test, developed by Brock, Dechert, and Scheinkman (1987). A spatial variant of the BDS test is introduced and applied in the context of two examples of spatial process models, one of which is concerned with the spatial distribution of regional investments in The Netherlands, the other with spatial crime patterns in Columbus, Ohio.

The negative externalities of uncontrolled immigration are well known and often hard to cope with. Recent years have seen the appearance of many policy initiatives based on self-reliance principles for ethnic groups. Against this background, ethnic entrepreneurship has become a popular strategy as it stimulates and encourages migrants to look after themselves with only limited support from the government: such policies are becoming increasingly important in many large cities. In addition to the conventional educational support and training programmes, such strategies need to implement policies aimed at self-employment. An emphasis on ethnic entrepreneurship is an attempt to exploit the economic potential and opportunities of foreign migrants, instead of focusing on the problems which minorities encounter when entering the labour market. In ethnic entrepreneurship this potential can be utilised in a creative way, especially if well-organised projects and initiatives are set up. The authors compare various assistance programmes and urban policies in several European cities, which are aimed at favouring ethnic entrepreneurship, with the aim of drawing lessons for effective labour-market policies. Their approach is to employ a systematic information base concerning self-employment strategies in the cities under investigation. A newly developed comparative statistical method for categorical information, namely, rough-set analysis, is used in order to identify critical success factors. The results suggest that utilisation of social networks is most helpful in enhancing self-employment among ethnic minorities.

This suggests that labour and residential mobility are mutually dependent and should be simultaneously analysed, based on a theory which incorporates these dynamic decisions explicitly. In the present paper, we base our analysis on search theory and choose the point of departure that individuals maximise utility by moving through different labour market and housing market states, while taking into consideration that moving from one state to another is costly. Based on these assumptions, a search model is constructed and the optimality conditions are derived.  One of main conclusions based on the search model is that the effect of factors which cause housing market imperfections (viz. the residential moving costs and the residence arrival rate) have ambiguous effects on he job acceptance and job search behaviour of employed individuals. For some interesting cases however, the effect of the residential moving costs on the job acceptance behaviour can be derived. In contrast, the effect of housing market imperfections on the labour market behaviour of nonemployed persons is determined. We find for example that housing policies which discourage nonemployed persons to move residence (e.g. housing subsidies) also decrease the probability of becoming employed and may therefore unintentionally increase the number of nonemployed persons.'] ['This paper focuses on the recruitment behaviour of firms at the extensive margin; we empirically explore the relationship between employer search strategies and the number of applicants by means of (reduced form) two-equations simultaneous models.

In particular, we see that in tight (slack) labour markets characterised by excess demand (supply) of labour, the flow of applicants is smaller (larger). Employers react to the shortage (excess) of applicants by using more (less) often advertisements. This recruitment channel appears to trigger a significantly larger flow of applicants.'] [' This paper addresses the issue of innovative behaviour of firms in an urban European context.

The focus of recent policies has been the liberalization of transport markets and the greater involvement of the private sector in providing actual transport services. There are theoretical grounds for suggesting this can enhance both the technical and dynamic efficiency of supply and these tend to be supported by the emerging empirical findings. However, there are difficulties with relying on market and competitive forces to provide network services. The nature of supply and demand characteristics associated with networks may not produce a stable market solution. At the extreme this can result in deficiencies in output and, under less theoretically rigid conditions, can lead to volatility in supply. The result is that even where transport may have the potential to enhance spatial cohesion this potential will not be completely realized.

Traditional neoclassical growth theory following Solow/Swan has mainly addressed questions about environmental and resource limits to growth. Recently, much attention is also devoted to the environment-growth interface from an endogenous growth perspective. However, an important element that is missing in both the neoclassical and endogenous growth approaches is a multiregional perspective. The present theoretical study tries to present one of the first attempts to fill this gap. The analysis is based on a model of two interactive regions, with possible interaction between the regional environments via the global environment. The implications of this type of analysis are manifold. One is that endogeneity of growth is not only due to technology and knowledge formation but also to the effects of trade, resource scarcity and environmental degradation. Another implication is that a coordinated environmental policy of regions should address long-term sustainability, and take account of the positive technological and negative environmental dynamic externalities.'] ['A new wave of interest in long-run economic growth emerged since the late 1980s. This paper uses a simple model to illustrate how technological change can be endogenised in macroeconomic theories of growth and then surveys how - through factor mobility, the diffusion of innovations and trade - spatial interdependence in a system of regions can influence technological change and growth. Endogenous technological change generates in our illustrative model long-run steady-state growth in a closed economy. However, it turns out that the dynamic impact of spatial interdependence depends on the specification of the model. Spatial convergence, a steady state with persisting spatial differences in growth rates and unstable growth are all theoretically possible. Issues relating to the role of aggregate demand and policy also receive attention. There is much scope for further theoretical and empirical work on endogenous growth in a spatial-economic context, while a better integration of micro and macro level approaches is also desirable.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['Placing a monetary value on aircraft noise is necessary in order to assess the social cost inflicted by aviation.

Airports with a low level of demand will not be the preferred hub, even if the larger airport charges higher taxes to recover costs.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['In this paper the possibilities of using tradeable permits in the regulation of road transport externalities are explored.

Main problems may occur in urban transport, where not many promising solutions are expected, while the problems are severe. In view of the great number of uncertainties, we will in our paper resort to the use of scenarios. We will address in particular expert scenarios, concerned with a sustainable transport system, by applying the recently developed spider model. Based on a set of distinct characteristics, represented in eight axes in the spatial, institutional, economic and social-psychological field, an evaluation framework is constructed which visualises the driving forces that largely influence the future of the urban transport system. Next, expected and desired scenarios are constructed on the basis of information obtained from a survey among Dutch transport experts (both average scenarios and scenarios reflecting segments of respondents). The expected scenarios show that many current trends will continue, while the transport system is largely the same as the current one. The desired scenarios on the other hand, suggest the emergence and the need for a more collective system, in which also many new modes are operating. In the paper the resulting urban transport systems are also discussed. By calculating the CO2 emissions in the average expected and desired scenario, we can test the fulfilment of environmental quality norms. It appears that the expected scenario does not lead to a significant reduction of those emissions; the desired scenario however, may lead to a large scale reduction of the emissions. The conclusion is that the differences in expert opinion are small and that a sustainable (urban) transport system is still far away in the future, although the compact city concept may perhaps offer a promising perspective.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['The effect of telematics technology on public transport use is analyzed on the basis of a theoretical model. Two possible mechanisms (reduction of uncertainty and a better choice of bus options, based on a general cost-minimization assumption) that may stimulate bus use are distinguished. The model is empirically tested by using microdata from the Southampton Stopwatch telematics project, which were collected both before and after the introduction of this telematics information service. The estimation of the model leads to interesting findings in explaining (anticipated) increases in bus use, for both the before and the after survey. It is shown that uncertainty reduction is the more important effect of the new system. Differences in the before and after data are found concerning the increase in bus use, but the explanatory model proves consistent over the two samples.'] [" The practical importance of recruitment is witnessed by the existence of specific personnel management functions within firms. The aim of the paper is to investigate the importance of firms' personnel management attitudes for recruitment procedures. We focus on the choice of the first search channel and on the subsequent search spell. The model is empirically estimated by using a data set on recruitment behaviour of Dutch firms. The results show that personnel management considerations are important for the choice of the recruitment channel. It appears that advertisement is preferred to the informal channel in that employers believe it is faster and generates applicants who better comply with the hiring standards. Furthermore, employers turn out to prefer mainly the informal channel when recruitment costs are considered important.

The performance of neural network analysis needs to be carefully judged, however, since the theoretical underpinning of neuro-computing is still weakly enveloped. In the present paper we will use the logit model as a benchmark for evaluating the result of neural network models, based on an empirical case study from Italy. The present paper aims to assess the foreseeable impact of the high-speed train in Italy, by investigating competition effects between rail and road transport modes. Two statistical models will then be compared, viz. the traditional logit model and a new technique for information processing, viz. the feedforward neural network model. In the study two different cases - corresponding to a different set of attributes - are investigated, namely by using only `time' attributes and by using both `time' and `cost' attributes. From an economic viewpoint, both models appear to highlight the advantage of introducing the high-speed train system in that they show high probabilities of choosing the improved rail transport mode. The feedforward neural net model seems to provide reasonable predictions compared to those obtained by means of a logit model. An important lesson however, is that it is important to define properly the neural network architecture and to train sufficiently the network during the learning phase.

The empirical analysis is based on an extensive survey held among road users in the Amsterdam corridor in July 1994. The data is stemming from the EC DRIVE II project BATT. To analyse the factors that influence route choice behaviour, several types of discrete choice models (ordered probit, multiple logit and bivariate ordered probit) have been estimated. Bivariate models are needed to model the (endogenous) dependency of the use of radio traffic information and variable message sign information. The results confirm earlier findings that women are less likely to be influenced by traffic information. New is the finding that commuters are less likely to be influenced, and that the level of satisfaction with alternative routes is strongly related to the type and distance of the alternative road. The analysis also reveals that the impacts of radio traffic information and variable message sign information on route choice behaviour are very similar, and that route choice adaptations based on radio traffic information are positively related to route choice adaptations based on variable message sign information. An interesting issue is the willingness-to-pay for having in-vehicle dynamic traffic information. As expected, the willingness-to-pay is relatively large for male drivers on business trips. Another important new finding is that the results suggest that there is a positive correlation between the use of radio traffic information and variable message sign information.'] [" CAPELLO R. and NIJKAMP P.

In the present paper the main area of analysis is the concept of network externalities and its interpretation from a theoretical, conceptual and empirical point of view. A conceptual framework is built on the proposition that network externalities are one of the decisive reasons for entering a telecommunication network. Since externality mechanisms arise at the user side and impact on the demand function, they can be labelled \xe2\x80\x9cconsumption network externalities\xe2\x80\x9d. However, this paper goes a step further than the recent literature by claiming that telecommunication networks are not only governed by consumption network externalities, but also generate production network externalities, since their advantages may be measured in terms of the performance of firms and regions. The paper presents a conceptual model on the role network externality plays on the performance of firms and regions, a methodology to measure these externalities at an empirical level and the results of the empirical analysis developed in Italy. Strong regional variations in the way network externalities are exploited emerge from the empirical analysis. CAPELLO R. et NIJKAMP P. (1996).

It can essentially be regarded as part of the general theoretical reflection on the role of telecommunications in economic development, by emphasising the importance of telecommunications for future economic growth. However, the advantages derived from these technologies stem not only from the technological changes taking place in the sector, but also from their nature as interrelated technologies. This stems from the fact that when a new subscriber joins the network, the marginal costs of his entry are lower than the marginal benefits he creates for people (firms) already networked. This difference between marginal costs and benefits (in favour of the benefits) inevitably reflects on industrial performance and - via multiplicative effects - on regional performance. The paper presents an empirical part where an effort is made to measure telecommunications network externalities. Regional differences in the exploitation of network externalities emerge between firms located in the north and in the south of Italy.'] ['In this paper, the impact of endogenous information provision to drivers in road transport is investigated. A static economic equilibrium model is used, which allows potential road users to buy information on the prevailing (stochastic) traffic situation. It takes for granted that an indiviual will try to acquire proper information when the private benefits of doing so exceed the private costs. By using an information model for road users, the interesting result is found that the provision of endogenous information leads to a strict Pareto improvement. Furthermore, the model shows that - depending on the price of information - it can be efficiency improving to subsidise or tax the motorist information to the user. Finally, there is a relationship between fine congestion pricing and subsidising motorist information. It turns out that the social welfare maximising subsidy under first-best congestion pricing is equal to zero. However, subsidising information may be an attractive policy instrument when a flat congestion pricing scheme is preferred.'] ["It is widely recognized that employers' hiring standards and spatial search radius are closely linked to their recruitment decisions. A strategy to identify the right people in the right place may save firms a substantial amount of effort and financial resources. Unfortunately, economic theory has often neglected this item when dealing with spatial search and recruitment issues. In this paper firms' recruitment strategies and channels of recruitment are addressed in relation to the spatial search radius for new employees. The spatial radius is linked to the employer's attempt to convey the vacancy-related information to a targeted group of potential applicants, with a focus on the distribution of the distance between the location of the firm and the place of residence of the hired applicant. In this framework, a new statistical model is developed in order to investigate the impact of different recruitment strategies -- which differ with respect to both the spatial search radius and the type of information used -- on the probability of a match between the vacant position and an applicant located at a given distance from the firm. The model is implemented and tested by means of an extensive micro data set on the recruitment behaviour of Dutch firms. It is found that job requirements with respect to educational level and required working experience are important elements in the recruitment procedure, as they significantly affect the spatial dimension of search. Moreover, the use of interactive information through informal communication channels seems to be effective for short-distance matches, thus suggesting the relevance of local contact networks."] ["This paper is focused on the intersection of two main policy 'tracks' followed in the Netherlands for the containment of road transport externalities: transport plans at the firm level, and regulatory parking policies. In this paper an applied modelling approach is taken, and the aim is to identify the relative importance of factors that are decisive for the viability of an individual firm's parking policies. The outcomes of an empirical survey conducted at the corporate level of the Free University in Amsterdam are used to discuss the social feasibility of regulatory parking policies conducted at the firm level (in terms of the employees' attitudes) and the effectiveness of such policies. Insight is provided into relevant backgrounds and obstacles serving to affect employees' commuting behaviour and that are likely to be encountered in the formulation of regulatory transport policies at the firm level. Moreover, the outcomes of this research may be relevant for the evaluation of regulatory parking policies at larger spatial scales (for example, neighbourhood parking schemes)."] ['Telematics applications have been introduced in the transport sector in order to improve the effective use of infrastructure networks, on the one hand, and to optimize the performance of the firm, on the other.

Results show, amongst other things, that: (1) markets for the various technologies are far from saturated; (2) adoption follows usual innovation diffusion patterns, with large firms being the first adopters; (3) automatic vehicle location systems are used only in combination with mobile telecommunications technologies.'] ['In many European countries, data on geographical patterns of internal elderly migration show that the elderly (55+) are more likely to leave than to move to the big cities. Besides emphasising the attractive features of the destination areas (pull factors), it is often assumed that this negative balance of migration of elderly people is caused by problems which mainly the big cities have to contend with and which would have a negative effect on living conditions, especially of the elderly (push factors). Although it is well-known that big cities in Europe are faced with several specific housing and neighbourhood problems, no detailed research has been carried out so far into whether these problems are indeed seen by the elderly themselves as very negative and, if so, whether these perceived problems result in an intention to move as a result of housing and neighbourhood dissatisfaction.

However, the successful exploitation of ATT in European transport markets depends on the technology being implemented in a way which meets the distinct needs of the different road user groups in order to achieve social acceptance and thereby political approval. It is therefore vitally important that decision makers (i.e. those influencing the adoption of ATT) have sufficient information on the needs of (commercial) road users and on the way they perceive ATT options in addressing those needs. The ATT market comprises a large number of actors from both the public and the private sector. At the demand side, some major potential market sectors can be identified. In addition to private users, there are intermediate or collective users (e.g., road authorities) and commercial users (e.g., the freight sector). In the latter case ATT may play a strategic role by facing the need of the freight sector to orient itself towards the opportunities offered by the European internal market, which has far-reaching impacts not only on organisations operating in international networks, but also on those operating nationally. The aim of the underlying study is to investigate the potential ATT market among these main user and interest groups, where the range of telematics applications will be restricted to those applied to inter-urban road transport. The focus will be on collective users (road managers) and commercial users (road freight operators). Surveys and in-depth interviews have been used to gather relevant information on the views, attitudes and expectations of these potential users. This empirical information provides interesting and policy relevant insights into the potential of ATT applications for each of these market segments."] ['This paper sketches the potential and critical success factors for European transport operations, with particular emphasis on the changing role of railway companies in European freight transport.

Although it is a first-best instrument in theory, it is argued that the assumptions needed to arrive at this conclusion oversimplify reality. In practice, congestion pricing is a second-best instrument with some advantages over other second-best instruments, but it will also give rise to numerous problems, as discussed in the paper. These problems will be illustrated with the Dutch attempts to implement an electronic road-pricing system. Some research issues relating to congestion pricing have been overlooked in the past. In the first instance, the behavioural side (motorists' responses) of congestion pricing has not been paid much attention. In general, it is argued that individuals are aiming to maximise utility (or minimise travel time). However, there seems to be an increasing recognition that this assumption does not properly describe reality. Second, the impact of the compensation scheme -- used to compensate drivers who are worse off under congestion pricing -- on the behavioural responses should be analysed more carefully in future work. This scheme might partly reverse the behavioural responses induced. Third, the welfare-generating properties of simple schemes should be looked at in future work. Fourth, given the potential opposition, we conclude that a cordon system, in which the price is dependent on the time of the day, is currently the most attractive option for pursuing a kind of congestion pricing. A cordon system might increase the individual's awareness of the costs of mobility during congested periods and be the first step towards more sophisticated pricing systems."] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['This paper explores roads toward environmentally sustainable transport, with particular emphasis on the bottlenecks preventing the achievement of policy objectives of reconciling the economic interests of the transport sector with environmental constraints.

Short critical descriptions are given of representative analytical models that have arisen in theories on economic growth with renewable and nonrenewable resources, and pollution, or that provide an interesting alternative view of economic - environmental interactions. These models appear to provide incomplete descriptions of economic, ecological, and interactive processes. To clarify the logic and special features of the general model, three issues are addressed.

These results also indicate that the importance of internal and external R &amp; D efforts for the generation of product innovations varies - and in an opposite pattern - according to the degree of urbanisation. These results underscore the spatial dimension of innovative behaviour.'] ['Spatial interaction models have received a great deal of attention in the past decade. In recent years, various approaches have also been developed to take into account dynamic aspects of spatial interaction models, by means of, for instance, optimal control theory, bifurcation theory, or catastrophe theory. The present paper deals with new directions in dynamic spatial interaction research. The focus is on a general dynamic interaction model analyzed in the framework of optimal control theory. The objective function used is a bicriterion utility model, to be maximized subject to a set of differential equations which bear some resemblance to those used by Wilson in a shopping-centre context. The link between the model presented and a catastrophe type of model is investigated. It is demonstrated that catastrophe behaviour may emerge as a particular case of this optimal control model. Finally, it is shown how external influences (for example, stochastic impacts of the Brownian motion type) affect the optimal trajectory.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['In this paper the spatial dimensions of technological developments are discussed. Special attention is given to entrepreneurship and the factors favouring the rise of new enterprises. A major component of such an incubator profile, the information infrastructure, is discussed more thoroughly (inter alia on the basis of a cross-national comparison). Last, the implications for regional policy and technology policy are spelt out.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['The issue of assessing the compound socioeconomic and historicocultural values of monuments is addressed. Monuments are part of the historical and cultural heritage of a country, region, or city. They are a potential source of economic development (for example, by means of tourism), but they also have their own indigenous value. A plea is made for planning for preservation of the cultural heritage by emphasizing the intangible attributes of urban monuments. In this context, the notion of option value plays an important role. The actual compound evaluation of cultural monuments, based on both user value and option value, is then undertaken by means of a recently developed multicriteria technique for qualitative assessment, namely the regime method. The method is briefly described and next applied to evaluate the socioeconomic and functional - urban value as well as the historicocultural value of twenty churches in the city of Thessaloniki. The results are presented in visual form by means of bar charts pertaining to three different types of scenarios. These outcomes appear to be reasonably robust across all scenarios. Some remarks are made about the use of such methods in the broader context of monument restoration policy.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['Attention is focused on nonlinear modelling in space and time, with particular emphasis on migration behaviour. A pedagogic overview is provided of the use of dynamic models for migration behaviour based on synergetic dynamic effects. This is followed by an attempt at identifying bifurcation points in the framework of a simple residential choice model. The paper begins with a discussion of various issues related to dynamic (spatial) economic models. Then the master equation approach (and the related mean value model) is discussed as an interesting and promising dynamic modelling framework for spatial interactions with synergetic effects. Next, to illustrate the potential of this approach, a framework of a nonlinear dynamic migration model is presented. Last, some results of a simulation experiment with a simple discrete choice model are also presented, in which particular emphasis is placed on the identification of bifurcation points.'] [' This paper provides a new contribution to the discussion on discount rates for social cost-benefit analysis of long-term plans, with a special emphasis on intergenerational problems. First, the use of the well-known net present value is critically discussed. Attention is focused on reinvestment possibilities; especially its shortcomings in long-run plan evaluation problems. The problem of multiple generations is then discussed. An adjusted intergenerational social discount rate is suggested, and its link with the conventional discount rate is formally be derived.'] ['Technology policy must be considered as a tailor-made endeavour towards the creation of specific innovative activities in specific sectors and at specific locations. It therefore cannot be implemented only from the national level but must be aimed at mobilizing also the self-organizing potential at regional and local levels. Technological change and regional structures turn out to be closely interrelated. For this theme issue contributions have been invited on general aspects of technology policy (Zegveld), on its regional implications (Malecki and Nijkamp), and on the relevance of sectoral policies and entrepreneurial strategies on the spatial diffusion of innovations (Dyckman and Swyngedouw). In further papers, three spatial types of technology policy are represented: a spatially deconcentrated major technology project in the form of the French technology city Sophia-Antipolis (Perrin), a decentralized three-tier national technology policy in Japan (Kawashima and St\xef\xbf\xbdhr), and a federal setting of technology policy in the case of the USA (Premus). In drawing conclusions from the papers in this theme issue, its editors discuss the question of how technology policy and regional policy can join to help create a broad entrepreneurial and innovative climate at the local scale.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['In the paper the authors outline the framework for research on transport, communications, and mobility, which underlies the network strategy currently being undertaken by the eighteen member countries of the European Science Foundation. They highlight the need for greater emphasis to be given, by policymakers throughout Europe as a whole, to the broader social and economic consequences of current trends in the field, and suggest that joint endeavour in this field is of paramount importance in order to exploit the research potential of the European countries.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' This paper discusses the effects of the investment premiums arrangement, which is one of the main instruments of regional economic policy in most Western countries. On the basis of theoretical considerations and various Dutch case studies, it is concluded that a basic revision of this policy instrument might lead to a reduction of the costs and an improvement of the effects. The case study presented in this paper applies the LISREL framework which allows the handling of latent and observable variables simultaneously. In this way, effects of policy packages, which are defined as latent variables, can be analyzed.

Various aspects and tools of such information systems are discussed. Next, an international comparison of spatial planning-systems and spatial information-systems in six countries is made by means of a systematic inventory and typology of attributes of these information systems. The author concludes that regional information-systems are in general not very well developed and suggests various ways for improving the current situation.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['This paper contains a discussion of some issues concerning spatial aspects of energy problems.

After a brief discussion of several common models (such as gravity models, entropy models, logit models, probit models and multiproportional Poisson models), the significance of these models is assessed by confronting them with the above-mentioned criteria, so that a qualitative evaluation can be made.The logit model which turns out to be a rather satisfactory spatial interaction model, is dealt with in more detail. Especially the problems of aggregation and disaggregation are analysed, while also a new contribution to logit models is provided by constructing a general probability density function for the population in case of more than two choice alternatives.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ["This paper is devoted to a discussion of the use of nonlinear multiobjective models for the analysis of environmental policy.

Consequently, problems like temporal autocorrelation have received much attention. Recently the attention of econometricians has also concentrated on spatial autocorrelation, particularly in the field of spatial interaction models. The existence of spatial autocorrelation among spatially dispersed phenomena appears to lead to significant differences in the treatment of multiregional models. In this paper, attention will be focused on the formal aspects of dynamic spatial diffusion models. Some statistical measures for temporal - spatial autocorrelation will be constructed. In addition, a formal derivation of necessary extensions in estimation procedures for dynamic multiregional econometric models will be presented, particularly in the field of seemingly unrelated regressions and instrumental variables. The analysis will be illustrated by means of a dynamic explanatory model for the spatial dispersion of foreign workers in The Netherlands.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['Cities around the world attempt to imitate the Silicon Valley model by adopting public policies aimed at attracting new high-tech industries and Research and Development activities. The adoption of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) as elements in a public policy is based on the expectations of policy-makers regarding the potential to harness technology to ameliorate key urban problems such as a deteriorating environment, congestion or lack of communications between citizens and institutions. More specifically, policy-makers are exposed to knowledge about ICT, which is supplied by a variety of sources like scientists, popular media and their own experience. This paper argues that two gaps typify the flow of knowledge consumed by urban decision-makers: the knowledge gap, namely the uncertainty about the actual impacts of ICT on urban issues, and the communication gap which relates to the biases and noise emanating from the process of communicating knowledge between different actors on potential ICT impacts. The communications gap can, to a large extent, be explained by language and cultural differences between scientists and policy-makers. To illustrate and emphasise the gaps and their role in the ICT policy-making process, in this paper a comparison is made with the more familiar case of transportation policy making.']
