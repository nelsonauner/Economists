Our results confirm the usual positive impact of institutional quality on official output and total factor productivity, and its negative impact on the size of the underground economy. However, once output is corrected for the shadow economy, the relationship between institutions and output becomes weaker. The impact of institutions on total (\xe2\x80\x9ccorrected\xe2\x80\x9d) factor productivity becomes insignificant. Differences in corrected output must then be attributed to differences in factor endowments. These results survive several tests for robustness.

We interpret these norms (called benefit morale and tax morale) as moral goods, and derive testable hypotheses on whether their demand is determined by prices. Employing a large survey data set from OECD-member countries we provide robust evidence that the demand responds to price proxy variables as predicted by theory. The main general conclusion of this article is that social norms (which are widely accepted as determinants of individual economic behaviour) are themselves influenced by economic factors.'] ['Monetary policy rules have been considered as fundamental protection against inflation. However, empirical evidence for a correlation between monetary commitment to rules and price stability is relatively weak. We discuss likely causes for this weak link and argue that monetary commitment is not necessarily credible by itself without adequate policy assignment and an institutional framework enforcing the commitment. We further propose a proxy variable for monetary credibility in an empirical assessment of our theoretical arguments based on panel data covering 22 OECD countries and five decades. Results confirm the crucial role of a credibly backed monetary commitment for price stability.'] ['In this paper, the main focus lies on the informal economy and on work in the shadow. The most influential factors on the informal economy are tax policies and state regulation. The size of the informal economy was decreasing over the period 1999 to 2007, from 34.0% to 31.2% for 161 countries (unweighted average). Furthermore, economic opportunities, taxes and regulations, the general situation on the labor market, and unemployment are crucial for an understanding of the dynamics of the shadow labor force. In contrast with the decrease of the informal economy (value added figures), the informal economy labor force increased for most countries over the period 1999 to 2007.'] [' This study provides an answer to the question of how much cash deposited via a financial institution can be traced back to criminal activities, by developing a new approach to measure money laundering and proposing an application to Italy.

Competition between influence groups for access to the resource rents, that is, rent-seeking, is often blamed for this curse. In this article, we dig deeper into the link between political competition and the resource curse by studying the case of Iran from 1960 to 2007. We present a theoretical model demonstrating how the effect of rents on the economy depends on the balance of political power. The model shows that an increase in rents may lead to a sharp reduction in income when the distribution of power between influence groups is relatively balanced. The empirical evidence confirms the predictions of the model.'] [' Whether a country is able effectively to address collective action problems is a critical test of its ability to fulfill the demands of its citizens to their satisfaction. We study one particularly important collective action problem: the environment. Using a large panel dataset covering 25 years for some countries, we find that, overall, citizens of European countries are more satisfied with the way democracy works in their country if (a) more environmental policies are in place and if (b) expenditures on the environment are higher, but environmental taxes are lower. The relation between environmental policy and life satisfaction is not as pronounced. The evidence for the effect of environmental quality on both satisfaction with democracy and life satisfaction is not very clear, although we find evidence that citizens value personal mobility (in terms of having a car) highly, but view the presence of trucks as unpleasant. We also document that parents, younger citizens, and those with high levels of educational attainment tend to care more about environmental issues than do non-parents, older citizens, and those with fewer years of schooling.

First, it presents a preliminary literature review of the empirical findings of the worldwide proceeds of transnational organized crime (TOC) and for some Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries as well as a breakdown of the different types of crime proceeds. Also the illegal cross-border flows of global dirty money (including tax fraud figures) are shown, which are by far the biggest share (66 percent) of all illegal transactions.

There are four main conclusions. First, the revenues of transnational crime are extremely difficult to estimate. Second, fighting transnational crime is very difficult, as there are no efficient and powerful international organizations that can effectively do this job. Third, tax fraud and/or other illegal cross-border capital flows should be the prime target for governments to reduce them.

This is a hugely complex and uncertain calculation, which depends on several important assumptions. These assumptions pertain to the different cost channels and the shares of these channels that can be attributed to the German participation in the war. By calculating the costs of the German participation, we provide a framework for other researchers to do the same with respect to other countries. The article can function as a roadmap for researchers focusing on this topic. In the end we find that, in the most realistic of several possible scenarios regarding the duration and intensity of the German participation in the war in Afghanistan, the German share of the net present value of the total costs of the war ranges from 26 billion Euro to 47 billion Euro. This large range reflects the uncertainties with which the costs must be estimated. On an annual basis, we estimate that the German participation in the war costs between 2.5 and 3 billion Euro. This contrasts with the official war budget, which is little over 1 billion Euro for 2010, showing that governments may not adequately represent the costs of military action.'] ["Prior research has concluded that socio-economic development does not significantly affect terrorism. We take an alternative view. First, we note that a country's socio-economic circumstances affect terrorists' behavior through terrorism's opportunity costs. We argue that this reasoning also holds for the case of supreme value terrorism. Then, we run a series of negative binomial regressions for 110 countries between 1971 and 2007 to test the hypothesis that poor socio-economic development is conducive to terrorism.

Our results suggest that German economists favor neoclassical economic theory as a school of thought and appreciate the contributions of their Anglo-Saxon colleagues much more than their fellow compatriots' contributions. Furthermore, a 'good' economist should have expertise in a certain field, as well as a broader knowledge of general economics. Some of the results can be compared to Colander (2008).

In particular, we analyze the impact of the welfare state on the respective social norm, i.e. benefit morale. It turns out that a high level of public social expenditures and a high unemployment rate are associated with a small positive (or no) immediate impact on benefit morale, which however is (partly) crowded out by adverse medium and long run effects.

Thus, new attempts in the tax compliance literature try to go beyond standard economic theory. This paper examines citizens? attitudes toward paying taxes ? what is sometimes termed their ?tax morale?, or the intrinsic motivation to pay taxes. Tax morale may be a key determinant to explain why people are honest. However, there are very few papers that explore the concept of tax morale theoretically and empirically. This study, based on the World Values Survey and the European Values Survey, therefore attempts to fill this gap in the literature, focusing on tax morale in Austria. Societal institutions such as trust or pride have been identified as key determinants that shape tax morale in Austria. Furthermore, a lower perceived compliance leads to a decrease of tax morale, which indicates that social comparisons are relevant. The results also show a decrease of tax morale between 1990 and 1999, although Austria?s taxpayers still have a very high tax morale compared to other European countries.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)'] ['Using the DYMIMIC approach, estimates of the shadow economy in 110 developing, transition and developed OECD countries are presented.

Overall, 252 fiscal officers, business students, business lawyers, and entrepreneurs produced spontaneous associations to a scenario either describing tax avoidance, tax evasion, or tax flight, and evaluated them as positive, neutral or negative. The results indicate that everyday representations differ with respect to tax avoidance, tax evasion, and tax flight.

Although fiscal officers judged all forms of tax reduction least fair, all sub-samples found tax evasion less fair than tax avoidance or tax flight.

With this paper we want to reopen the debate on how citizens can be involved in this process. We try to show how citizen preferences can be included in the process of pollution control through emission trading. We propose an emission trading system where all emission permits are initially allocated to households who are then allowed to sell them in the permit market or to withhold (at least some of) them in order to reduce total pollution. This proposal tries to overcome the fundamental disadvantage of traditional permit systems which neglect consumer preferences by solely distributing emission permits to producers / polluters. In our system the property right to nature is re-allocated to the households who obtain the opportunity of reducing actual emissions according to their personal preferences by withholding a part or all of the emission permits allotted to them. Such a change in environmental policy would mark a return to the traditional principles of consumer sovereignty by involving households (at least partially) in the social abatement decision process instead of excluding them. Another advantage of admitting households to the TEP market as sellers or buyers of permits is that this increases the number of agents in the permit market and thus significantly reduces the possibilities of strategic market manipulations.

In representative democracies governments quite often use an expansion of the social security policies for their own selfish purposes. Voters are in favour of such a widening of social security programmes as long as the burden of financing is not very visible. If the burden of taxation becomes visible and the government has to reduce its expenditures, no group of voters wants to carry the well visible and painful reductions of spending programmes, especially when the whole electorate benefits from tax rates, which are not increased further (or they may even be lower). Citizens in direct democracies have more possibilities to influence policy questions, e.g. in a referendum over a change in the government's policy. The empirical investigation of two referenda proposals concerning the future development of the Swiss social security system demonstrates that the decision of the electorate was based on various short and long term considerations.

On examine enfin les possibilit\xc3\xa9s d'extension de ces mod\xc3\xa8les politico-\xc3\xa9conomiques. [eng] Interactions between the econome and the polity : a synthesis of theoretical and empirical studies. Friedrich Schneider, Werner Pommerehne, Jean-Dominique Lafay. Studies of the Western democraties and Eastern socialist countries are surveyed analyzing the interaction between the economy and polity. The influence of economie and political factors on voters' behavior, as described by popularity functions, is studied for varions time periods and institutional franwworks. How government reacts to this in Western democraties is modelled assuming a satisficing approach aimed at either securing re-election or the pursuit of ideological goals. For socialist countries it is shown that high-ranking government members will be dismissed if the state of the economy is unsatisfactory. Possible extensions of such politico-economic models are also discussed."] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.']
