While other English-speaking countries have also experienced sharp increases in the top 1 percent income share, many high-income countries such as Japan, France, or Germany have seen much less increase in top income shares. Hence, the explanation cannot rely solely on forces common to advanced countries, such as the impact of new technologies and globalization on the supply and demand for skills. Moreover, the explanations have to accommodate the falls in top income shares earlier in the twentieth century experienced in virtually all high-income countries. We highlight four main factors. The first is the impact of tax policy, which has varied over time and differs across countries. Top tax rates have moved in the opposite direction from top income shares. The effects of top rate cuts can operate in conjunction with other mechanisms. The second factor is a richer view of the labor market, where we contrast the standard supply-side model with one where pay is determined by bargaining and the reactions to top rate cuts may lead simply to a redistribution of surplus. Indeed, top rate cuts may lead managerial energies to be diverted to increasing their remuneration at the expense of enterprise growth and employment. The third factor is capital income. Overall, private wealth (relative to income) has followed a U-shaped path over time, particularly in Europe, where inherited wealth is, in Europe if not in the United States, making a return. The fourth, little investigated, element is the correlation between earned income and capital income, which has substantially increased in recent decades in the United States.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['Charitable giving is an important source of funding for overseas development and emergency relief.

Top incomes represent a small share of the population but a very significant share of total income and total taxes paid. Hence, aggregate economic growth per capita and Gini inequality indexes are sensitive to excluding or including top incomes. We discuss the estimation methods and issues that arise when constructing top income share series, including income definition and comparability over time and across countries, tax avoidance, and tax evasion. We provide a summary of the key empirical findings. Most countries experience a dramatic drop in top income shares in the first part of the twentieth century in general due to shocks to top capital incomes during the wars and depression shocks. Top income shares do not recover in the immediate postwar decades. However, over the last thirty years, top income shares have increased substantially in English speaking countries and in India and China but not in continental European countries or Japan. This increase is due in part to an unprecedented surge in top wage incomes. As a result, wage income comprises a larger fraction of top incomes than in the past. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and empirical models that have been proposed to account for the facts and the main questions that remain open.

Instead, an "identification" approach to individual giving is proposed here that combines the results focus of the public goods formulation with the scale of the warm-glow model. The theoretical model is used to examine the implications for public policy, including the extent to which official aid crowds out private giving and how public policy should take account of private willingness to make charitable transfers overseas.'] [' This paper identifies three reasons for studying factor shares: to make a link between incomes at the macroeconomic level (national accounts) and incomes at the level of the household; to help understand inequality in the personal distribution of income; and to address the concern of social justice with the fairness of different sources of income.

These forces include the policy choices made by governments affecting market incomes and fiscal redistribution. What we need to explain is why in some periods a number of these forces combine to produce episodes of rising, or falling, inequality.

The approach is essentially comparative: we model the effects of introducing into the French structure elements from the British tax and benefit system. It is argued that, when cash amounts are scaled up to ensure revenue-neutrality, such a change would in fact be progressive in terms both of income and family size.'] [" This survey of James M.

The general theme is that th ere is a diversity of judgments which enter the measurement of povert y and it is necessary to recognize these explicitly in the procedures adopted. It is argued that dominance conditions provide tools which are both powerful and easy to apply empirically. Examples are given f or the United States.

Given insufficient data, the estimation of the models has commonly proceeded by making assumptions which reduce the data requirements. In particular, it has been assumed (often implicitly) that the distribution of the variables being studied is in steady-state. In this paper we examine the role of this assumption and argue the need for care in its use.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ["This article describes research on the analysis of the consequences of changes in personal taxation and social security carried out as part of the SSRC Programme on Taxation, Incentives and the Distribution of Income. It shows how data from the Family Expenditure Survey can be used to see who gains and who loses from policy changes, illustrating this by an examination of proposals for a tax credit scheme. It discusses the incorporation of changes in behaviour, and the effect of taxes and benefits on incentives, including the 'poverty trap'. Particular emphasis is placed on the accessibility of the analysis, and the last section describes a range of programs which are available for use on micro-computers."] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ["At the end of the 1970s there appeared to be wide agreement as to the desirability of switching the burden of taxation away from direct taxes towards indirect taxes. In concrete terms, there was strong pressure for cuts in income taxation to be financed, where necessary, by a rise in the rate of value added tax; and this process was set in motion in the Budget of June 1979, with the reduction of the basic rate of income tax to 30 per cent and the rise in VAT to 15 per cent. Third Paragraph - The aim of this paper is to explore some of the arguements which can be advanced to support a switch from direct to indirect taxation, concentrating on income tax on one side and the value added tax on the other. What is the reasoning which lies behind the case for such a switch? It is an arguement in terms of incentives? Can we switch be justified in terms of its consequences for underlying economic welfare? Or was Gladstone right when he referred to direct and indirect taxes as 'two attractive sisters' to whom he should pay his addresses equally?"] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] ['No abstract is available for this item.'] [' This comment presents an analysis of the effect of regulation on the sales-maximizing firm, and shows that the models used in earlier works have been incorrectly specified.
