Some kinds of spell identification require two passes through the data, as when only spells of some minimum length are of interest or short gaps are tolerable within spells. Many questions concerning spells are easy to answer given careful use of by: and appropriate sort order, selection of just 1 observation from each panel or spell, and appreciation of the many functions written for egen.

This column focuses on techniques for answering such questions while maintaining the same data structure.
